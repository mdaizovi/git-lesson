maybe if my heart stops
beating it wont hurt this much
and never will i have to
answer again to anyone

please dont get me wrong
because ill never let this go
but i cant find the words to tell you
i dont wanna be alone
but now i feel like i dont know you

one day youll get sick of saying
that everythings alright
and by then im sure ill be 
pretending just like i am tonight

please dont get me wrong
because ill never let this go
but i cant find the words to tell you
i dont wanna be alone
but now i feel like i dont know you

let this go
let this go

ill never let this go
but i cant find the words to tell you
i dont wanna be alone
but now i feel like i dont know you

and ill never let this go
but i cant find the words to tell you
that now i feel like i dont know you
