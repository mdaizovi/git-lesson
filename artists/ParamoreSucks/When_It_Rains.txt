and when it rains on this side of town
it touches everything
just say it again and mean it

we dont miss a thing
you made yourself a bed at the bottom
of the blackest hole blackest hole
and convinced yourself
that its not the reason you dont see the sun anymore

and no oh
how could you do it
oh i
i never saw it coming
no oh
i need an ending
so why cant you stay
just long enough to explain

and when it rains you always find an escape
just running away
from all of the ones who love you
from everything

you made yourself a bed at the bottom
of the blackest hole blackest hole
and youll sleep till may
youll say that you dont wanna see the sun anymore

and no oh
how could you do it
oh i
i never saw it coming
no oh
i need an ending
so why cant you stay
just long enough to explain

explain your side take my side
take these chances to turn it around
lets take these chances well make it somehow
and take these chances and turn it around
just turn it around

no
how could you do it
oh i
i never saw it coming

no oh
how could you do it
oh i
i never saw it coming
no oh
how could you do it
oh i
i never saw it coming
no oh
i need an ending
so why cant you stay
just long enough to explain

you can take your time take my time
