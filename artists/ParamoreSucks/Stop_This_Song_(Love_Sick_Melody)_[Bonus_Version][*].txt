you say the sweetest things and i
cant keep my heart from singing along to the sound of your song
my stupid feet keep moving to this 44 beat im in time with you
whoa to this 44 beat i would die for you die for you

someone stop this
ive gone to far to come back from here but you dont have a clue
you dont know what you do to me

wont someone stop this song so i wont sing along
someone stop this song so i wont sing

i never let love in so i could keep my heart from hurting
the longer that i live with this idea 
the more i sink into this 44 beat
im in time with you
whoa to this 44 beat i would die for you stop this song

ive gone to far to come back from here 
but you dont have a clue
you dont know what you do to me
ive come to far to get over you 
and you dont have a clue
you dont know what you do to me

cant someone stop this song so i wont sing along
someone stop this song so i wont sing

your lovesick melody is gonna get the best of me tonight
but you wont get to me if i dont sing

it creeps in like a spider
cant be killed although i try and try to
well dont you see im falling
dont wanna love you but i do

lovesick melody 
can someone stop this song so i wont sing along
lovesick melody 
can someone stop this song so i wont sing
your lovesick melody is gonna get the best of me tonight
but you wont get to me no
you wont get to me cause i wont sing
