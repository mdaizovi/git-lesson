cant count the years on one hand that weve been together
i need the other one to hold you
make you feel make you feel better
its not a walk in the park to love each other
but when our fingers interlock cant deny cant deny youre the worth it

cause after all this time
im still into you

i should be over all the butterflies but im into you im into you
and even baby our worst nights
im into you im into you
let em wonder how we got this far
cause i dont really need to wonder at all
yeah after all this time
im still into you

recount the night that i first met your mother
and on the drive back to my house i told you that i told you that i loved ya
you felt the weight of the world fall off the shoulder
and to your favorite song we sang along to the start of forever

and after all this time
im still into you

i should be over all the butterflies but im into you im into you
and even baby our worst nights
im into you im into you
let em wonder how we got this far
cause i dont really need to wonder at all
yeah after all this time
im still into you

some things just some things just make sense
and one of those is you and i
some things just some things just make sense
and even after all this time

im into you
baby not a day goes by that im not into you

i should be over all the butterflies but im into you im into you
and even baby our worst nights
im into you im into you
let em wonder how we got this far
cause i dont really need to wonder at all
yeah after all this time
im still into you
im still into you
im still into you
