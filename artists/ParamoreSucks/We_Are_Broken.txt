i am outside
and ive been waiting for the sun
with my wide eyes
ive seen worlds that dont belong
my mouth is dry with words i cannot verbalize
tell me why we live like this

keep me safe inside
your arms like towers
tower over me

yeah

chorus
cause we are broken
what must we do to restore
our innocence
and oh the promise we adored
give us life again cause we just wanna be whole

lock the doors
cause i like to capture this voice
it came to me tonight
so everyone will have a choice
and under red lights
ill show myself it wasnt forged
were at war
we live like this

keep me safe inside
your arms like towers
tower over me

chorus

tower over me
tower over me

and ill take the truth at any cost

chorus
