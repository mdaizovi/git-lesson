now when you say you wanna slow down
does it mean you wanna slow dance
maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
on our romance

what do you mean i got it backwards
you know were gonna be forever
why are you telling me goodbye
arent you gonna stay the night

are we really over now
maybe i can change your mind
soon as you walk out my door
im gonna call a hundred times

now i walk under a pink sky
lovers for long and pass me by
i poured my heart out to your voice mail
let you know i caught a bus to your side of town

and now im standing at your doorstep
with los angeles behind me dear
if you dont answer ill just use the key that i copied
cause i really need to see you

youre not here when i break in
im gonna go into your closet
just so i can smell your skin
as the chemicals swim
i know ill never love again
i swear ill never love again

baby are we really over now
maybe i can change your mind
soon as you walk out my door
im gonna call a hundred times

im not one of those crazy girls
im not one of those crazy girls
im not one of those crazy girls
im not one of those crazy girls

hey baby are we really over now
maybe i can change your mind
soon as you walk out my door
im gonna call a hundred times

baby are we really over now
maybe i can change your mind
soon as you walk out my door
im gonna call a hundred times

now im one of those crazy girls
now im one of those crazy girls
now im one of those crazy girls
now im one of those crazy girls
