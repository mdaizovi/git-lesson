im writing the future
im writing it out loud
we dont talk about the past
we dont talk about the past now

so im writing the future
im leaving a key here
something wont always be missing
it wont always feel empty here

just think of the future
and think of your dreams
youll get away from here
youll get away eventually

so just think of your future
think of a new life
dont get lost in the memories
keep your eyes on a new prize
