standing here like im supposed to say something
dont hold your breath i never said id save you honey
and i dont want your money
if i was you id run from me or rip me open
youll see youre not the only one whos hopeless
be sure to put your faith in something more
im just a girl and youre not as alone as you feel
we all got problems dont we
we all need heroes dont we
but rest assured theres not a single person here whos worthy

la la la la la la la
dont let me let you down

hey baby im not your superhuman 
and if thats what you want
i hate to let you down 
i got your hopes up
now i got you hoping 
but im gonna be the one that let you down

oh its such a long and awful lonely fall
down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
what if i fall on my face
what if i make a mistake
if its okay a little grace would be appreciated
remember how we used to like ourselves
what little light thats left we need to keep it sacred
i know that youre afraid to let all the dark escape ya
but we could let the light illuminate these hopeless places

la la la la la la la
just let me let you down

hey baby im not your superhuman 
and if thats what you want
i hate to let you down 
i got your hopes up
now i got you hoping 
but im gonna be the one that let you down

la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la

oh no i aint your hero
youre wasting all your faith on me
oh no i know where this goes
they can say they say this doesnt look a thing like me

la la la la la la la
dont let me let you down

hey baby im not your superhuman
and if thats what you want
i hate to let you down 
i got your hopes up
now i got you hoping 
but im gonna be the one that let you down

hey baby im not your superhuman
and if thats what you want
i hate to let you down 
i got your hopes up
now i got you hoping
but im gonna be the one that let you down
