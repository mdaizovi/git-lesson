think of me when youre out when youre out there
ill beg you nice from my knees
and when the world treats you way too fairly
well its a shame im a dream

all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you

i think ill pace my apartment a few times
and fall asleep on the couch
wake up early to black and white reruns
that escaped from my mouth

oh oh

all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you

i could follow you to the beginning
and just to relive the start
and maybe then well remember to slow down
at all of our favorite parts

all i wanted was you

all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
