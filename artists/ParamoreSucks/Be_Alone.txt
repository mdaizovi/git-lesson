so what if i dont have a lot to talk about
i shove my mouth and keep it locked until it comes
and what if i dont ever want to leave my house
stay on the couch while all my friends are going out

alone
you should be alone
yeah you should be alone
you should be alone with me
we could be alone
yeah we could be alone
but never get too low on me

i make the journey down the hall back to my room
but you want time then let it ride inside in silence too
see i aint want to climb some social ladder too
some shanghailas that all the cool kids will abuse

alone
you should be alone
yeah you should be alone
you should be alone with me
we could be alone
yeah we could be alone
but never get too low on me

we could be alone together

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
im alone now im in love with you alone
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
come be alone ill be in love with you alone

oh oh oh oh oh

you should be alone
yeah you should be alone
you should be alone with me
we could be alone
yeah we could be alone
but never get too low on me

you should be alone
yeah you should be alone
you should be alone with me
we could be alone
yeah we could be alone
but never get too low on me
