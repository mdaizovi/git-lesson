with all the things we said
and not a minute spent
to think that wed regret

these words and hold our breath
forget the things we swore we meant

with all the things we did
and now im wondering

to be the one attached
at all times to your hip

ill write you just to let you know that im alright
cant say im sad to see you go
cause im not no im not
well im not no im not no im not
