just talk yourself up
and tear yourself down
you ripped through one wall
now find a way around
well whats the problem
youve got a lot of nerve

whatd you think i would say
you cant run away you cant run away
so what did you think i would say
you cant run away you cant run away
you wouldnt

i never wanted to say this
you never wanted to stay
i put my faith in you so much faith
and then you just threw it away
you threw it away

im not so naive
my sorry eyes can see
the way you fly shy
of almost everything
well if you give up
youll get what you deserve

whatd you think i would say
no you cant run away no you cant run away
so what did you think i would say
no you cant run away no you cant run away
you wouldnt

i never wanted to say this
you never wanted to stay
i put my faith in you so much faith
and then you just threw it away
you threw it away

you were finished long before
we had even seen the start
why dont you stand up be a man about it
fight with your bare hands about it now

i never wanted to say this
you never wanted to stay
i put my faith in you so much faith
and then you just threw it away
you threw it away

i never wanted to say this
you never wanted to stay
i put my faith in you so much faith
and then you just threw it away
you threw it away
