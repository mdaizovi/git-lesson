things are looking up oh finally
i thought id never see the day
when you smile at me
we always pull through oh when we try
im always wrong but youre never right
oh youre never right

honestly can you believe
we crossed the world while its asleep
id never trade it in cause ive always wanted this
and its not a dream anymore
no its not a dream anymore
its worth fighting for

could have given up so easily
i was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
taken for granted almost everything that i would have died for
just yesterday
just yesterday

honestly can you believe
we crossed the world while its asleep
id never trade it in cause ive always wanted this
its not a dream anymore
oh its not a dream anymore
its worth fighting for

god knows the world doesnt need another band whoa whoa
but what a waste it wouldve been whoa whoa
i cant believe we almost hung it up whoa whoa
were just getting started whoa whoa

honestly can you believe
we crossed the world while its asleep
id never trade it in cause ive always wanted this
its not a dream anymore
oh its not a dream anymore
its worth fighting for

i cant believe we almost hung it upwhoa whoa
were just getting started whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
