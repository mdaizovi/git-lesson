we tried so hard to understand
but we cant
we held the world out in our hands
and you ran away

it takes some time to let you go
and it shows
cause all we know is falling
remember how cause i know that we wont forget at all

now we can follow you back home
but we wont
is this what you had waited for
just to be alone

it takes some time to let you go
and it shows
cause all we know is falling it falls
remember how cause i know that we wont forget at all

you never
you never said
this wasnt what you wanted
was it
was it

this isnt what you wanted
this isnt what you wanted
cause all we know
is falling it falls
remember how cause i know that we wont
forget it all
