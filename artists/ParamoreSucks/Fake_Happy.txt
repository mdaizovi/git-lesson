i love making you believe
what you get is what you see
but im so fake happy
i feel so fake happy
and i bet everybody here
is just as insincere
were all so fake happy
and i know fake happy

i been doing a good job of makin em think
im quite alright
but i hope i dont blink
you see its easy when im stomping on a beat
but no one sees me when i crawl back underneath

if i smile with my teeth
bet you believe me
if i smile with my teeth
i think i believe me

oh please dont ask me how ive been
dont make me play pretend
oh no oh whats the use
oh please i bet everybody here is fake happy too

and if i go out tonight dress up my fears
you think ill look alright with these mascara tears
see im gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth
and if the lights are low theyll never see me frown

if i smile with my teeth
bet you believe me
if i smile with my teeth
i think i believe me

oh please dont ask me how ive been
dont make me play pretend
oh no oh oh whats the use
oh please i bet everybody here is fake happy too

i know i said that i was doing good and that im happy now
oh oh
i shouldve known that when things are going good thats when i get knocked down

oh please just dont ask me how ive been
dont make me play pretend
oh no oh no
oh whats the use
oh please i bet everybody here is fake happy too
oh please i bet everybody here is fake happy too
