rosecolored boy
i hear you making all that noise
about the world you want to see
and oh im so annoyed
cause i just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

i had to break it the wars are raging on
and i have taken my glasses off
you got me nervous
im right at the end of my rope
a half empty girl
dont make me laugh ill choke

just let me cry a little bit longer
i aint gon smile if i dont want to
hey man we all cant be like you
i wish we were all rosecolored too
my rosecolored boy

lowkey no pressure just hang with me and my weather

i want you to stop insisting that im not a lost cause
cause ive been through a lot
really all ive got is just to stay pissed off
if its all right by you

i had to break it the wars are raging on
and i have taken my glasses off
you got me nervous
and youre turning it into a joke
a half empty girl
dont make me laugh ill

just let me cry a little bit longer
i aint gon smile if i dont want to
hey man we all cant be like you
i wish we were all rosecolored too
my rosecolored boy

leave me here a little bit longer
i think i wanna stay in the car
i dont want anybody seeing me cry now
you say we gotta look on the bright side
i say well maybe if you wanna go blind
you say my eyes are getting too dark now
but boy you aint ever seen my mind

just let me cry a little bit longer
i aint gon smile if i dont want to
hey man we all cant be like you
i wish we were all rosecolored too
my rosecolored boy
just let me cry a little bit longer
i aint gon smile if i dont want to
i know we all cant be like you
i wish we were all rosecolored too
my rosecolored boy
