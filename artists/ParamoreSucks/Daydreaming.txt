living in a city of sleepless people
who all know the limits and won’t go too far outside the lines
cause theyre out of their minds
i wanna get out and build my own home
on a street where reality is not much different from dreams ive had
a dream is all i have

daydreaming daydreaming all the time
daydreaming daydreaming into the night
daydreaming daydreaming all the time
daydreaming daydreaming into the night
and im alright

creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
we wait for the bell
and we dream of somewhere else

daydreaming daydreaming all the time
daydreaming daydreaming into the night
daydreaming daydreaming all the time
daydreaming daydreaming into the night
and im alright

its not that i won’t remember where im from
just dont wanna be here no more
its not enough we’re only half alive
i’m gonna go were only half alive
where the rest of the dreamers go
where the dreamers go

daydreaming daydreaming all the time
daydreaming daydreaming into the night
and im alright
daydreaming daydreaming all the time
daydreamer we used to be half alive
now im alright
im alright im alright
