as if the first cut wasnt deep enough
i dove in again cause im not into giving up
couldve gotten the same rush from any lovers touch
why get used to something new
cause no one breaks my heart like you

and you kiss me and you wish could see what happens next
for a moment i can forget what happens in my head
if i doubt you will you come through with a happy second chance
a happy ending
but this time you dont leave me sinking

im underwater
with no air in my lungs
my eyes are open
im done giving up
you are the wave
i could never tame
if i survive
ill dive back in

as if the first blood didnt thrill enough
i went further out to see what else was left of us
never found the deep end of our little ocean
drain the fantasy of you
headfirst into shallow pools

and i wonder is it better to get it over with
the illusion can shatter before we begin
if youre really sorry
happy second chance i think i could forgive
this time you wont leave me sinking

im underwater
with no air in my lungs
my eyes are open
im done giving up
you are the wave
i could never tame
if i survive
ill dive back in

dive back into
right back into
dive right back into you
now i know you
now i know you
now that i know you
dive right back into you
dive back into
right back into you
dive right back into you
now i know you
now i know you
now that i know you
dive right back into you

im underwater
with no air in my lungs
my eyes are open
im done giving up
you are the wave
i could never tame
if i survive
ill dive back in

im underwater
with no air in my lungs
my eyes are open
im done giving up
you are the wave
i could never tame
if i survive
ill dive back in
ill dive back in
ill dive back
