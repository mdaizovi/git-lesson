i dont even know myself at all
i thought i would be happy but now
the more i try to push it i realize gonna let go of control

gonna let it happen gonna let it happen
gonna let it happen just let it happen

its just a spark but its enough to keep me going
and when its dark out and no ones around it keeps glowing

every night i try my best to dream tomorrow makes it better
and wake up to the cold reality and not a thing is changed
but it would be happen gonna let it happen
gonna let it happen gonna let it happen

its just a spark but its enough to keep me going
and when its dark out and no ones around it keeps glowing
its just a spark but its enough to keep me going
and when its dark out and no ones around it keeps glowing

and the salt in my wounds isnt burning anymore than it used to
its not that i dont feel the pain its just im not afraid of hurting anymore
and the blood of these veins isnt pumping any less than it ever has
and thats the hope i have the only thing i know thats keeping me alive
alive

gonna let it happen gonna let it happen
gonna let it happen gonna let it happen
gonna let it happen gonna let it happen
gonna let it happen gonna let it happen

its just a spark but its enough to keep me going
and when its dark out and no ones around it keeps glowing
its just a spark but its enough to keep me going
and when its dark out and no ones around it keeps glowing
