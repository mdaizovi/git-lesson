dont try to take this from me
dont try to take this from me now

dont try to take this from me
dont try to take this from me now

feels like im waking from the dead
and everyones been waitin on me
least now ill never have to wonder
what its like to sleep a year away
but were we indestructible
i thought that we could brave it all
i never thought that what would take me out
was hiding down below

lost the battle win the war
bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
were starting over or head back in
theres a time and a place to die but this aint it

if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now

dont try to take this from me
dont try to take this from me now

dont try to take this from me
dont try to take this from me now

wish i could find a crystal ball
for the days i feel completely worthless
you know id use it all for good
i would not take it for granted
instead id have some memories
for the days i dont feel anything
at least they would remind me
not to make the same mistakes again

lost the battle win the war
im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
were starting over or head back in
theres a time and a place to die but this aint it

if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now

theres a time and a place to die

theres a time and a place to die
and this aint it

theres a time and a place to die
and this aint it this aint it
this aint it

theres a time and a place to die
theres a time and a place to die
but this aint it no

if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now
if theres a future we want it now

if theres a future we want it now
now now
