somehow everythings gonna fall right into place
if we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday
if only time flew like a dove
we gotta make it fly faster than im falling in love

this time were not giving up
lets make it last forever
screaming hallelujah
well make it last forever

holding onto patience wearing thin
i cant force these eyes to see the end
if only time flew like a dove
we could watch it fly and just keep looking on

this time were not giving up
lets make it last forever
screaming hallelujah
well make it last forever

and weve got time on our hands
and weve got got nothing but time on our hands
got nothing but got nothing but
got nothing but time on our hands

this time were not giving up
oh lets make it last forever
screaming hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah
