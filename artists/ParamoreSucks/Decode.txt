how can i decide whats right
when youre clouding up my mind
i cant win your losing fight
all the time

not gonna ever own whats mine
when youre always taking sides
but you wont take away my pride
no not this time
not this time

how did we get here
when i used to know you so well
how did we get here
well i think i know how

the truth is hiding in your eyes
and its hanging on your tongue
just boiling in my blood
but you think that i cant see
what kind of man that you are
if youre a man at all
well i will figure this one out
on my own
im screaming i love you so
on my own
my thoughts you cant decode

how did we get here
when i used to know you so well yeah
how did we get here
well i think i know how

do you see what weve done
weve gone and made such fools
of ourselves
do you see what weve done
weve gone and made such fools
of ourselves

how did we get here
when i used to know you so well yeah yeah
well how did we get here
when i used to know you so well
i think i know
i think i know

there is something i see in you
it might kill me
but i want it to be true
