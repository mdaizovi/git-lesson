been through the ringer a couple times
i came out callous and cruel
and my two friends know this very well
because they went through it too

the three of us were initiates
we had to learn how to deal
and when we spotted a second chance
we had to learn how to steal

hollowed out and
filled up with hate
all we want is
you to give us a break

we’re driving fast in my car
we’ve got our riot gear on
but we just want to have fun
no we’re not looking for violence
tonight we want to have fun

no one’s the same as they used to be
much as we try to pretend
no one’s as innocent as could be
we all fall short we all sin

but now we are looking backward
we won’t try raising the dead
we only see what’s in front of us
we only see straight ahead

hollowed out and
filled up with hate
all we want is
you to give us a break

we’re driving fast in my car
we’ve got our riot gear on
but we just want to have fun
no we’re not looking for violence
tonight we want to have fun

get in my car and we’ll drive around
and make believe we are free
already proved we can tough it up
and we get along so smoothly

we’re driving fast in my car
we’ve got our riot gear on
but we just want to have fun
no we’re not looking for violence
tonight we want to have fun

we’re driving fast in my car
we’re driving fast in my car
no we’re not looking for violence
we’re driving fast in my car
and we just want to have fun
