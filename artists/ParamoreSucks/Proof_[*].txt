its really hard i cant cry in your arms
cause youre not here
its not your fault and if it was i wouldnt care
my heart is bigger than the distance inbetween us
i know it â€˜cause i feel it beating
so strong and ill knock you down
so strong so strong

over here
you can count the miles away from where i wanna be
bet your skin is warm and that youre smiling
yea thats what i always loved the most about you
youre so strong come and knock me down

baby if im half the man i say i am
if im a woman with no feel just like i claim i am
then i believe in what you say theres nothing left for you to do
the only proof that i need is you

ill get in my car
driving faster than i ever did before
i wont rest until i finally reach the shore
and then ill swim back to wherever you are
and well ride beyond of coming down to the floor

making friends with all the unfamiliar pictures
push it back ill be your necessary pleasure
come up for air just so you know we wont drown
youre so strong then why cant you cross out hey

baby if im half the man i say i am
if im a woman with no feel just like i claim i am
then i believe in what you say theres nothing left for you to do
the only proof that i need is you

all you gotta do is say yes
now do you love me
and i wont ever second guess
now do you love me
all you gotta do is say yes

then you already proved it

baby if im half the man i say i am
if im a woman with no feel just like i claim i am
