down to you
youre pushing and pulling me down to you
but i dont know what i
now when i caught myself i had to stop myself
im saying something that i should have never thought
now when i caught myself i had to stop myself
im saying something that i should have never thought of you of you

youre pushing and pulling me down to you
but i dont know what i want
no i dont know what i want

you got it you got it
some kind of magic
hypnotic hypnotic
youre leaving me breathless
i hate this i hate this
youre not the one i believe in
with god as my witness

now when i caught myself i had to stop myself
im saying something that i should have never thought
now when i caught myself i had to stop myself
im saying something that i should have never thought of you

youre pushing and pulling me down to you
but i dont know what i want
no i dont know what i want

dont know what i want
but i know its not you
keep pushing and pulling me down
but i know in my heart its not you

now when i caught myself i had to stop myself
im saying something that i should have never thought
now when i caught myself i had to stop myself
im saying something that i should have never thought of you
i knew i know in my heart its not you
i knew but now i know what i want i want i want
oh no i should have never thought
