i cant think of getting old
it only makes me want to die
and i cant think of who i was
cause it just makes me want to cry cry cry
cant look back cant look too far ahead
i got the point i got the message

im just a little bit caught in the middle
i try to keep going but its not that simple
i think im a little bit caught in the middle
gotta keep going or theyll call me a quitter
yeah im caught in the middle

i was dreaming life away
all the while just going blind
cant see the forest for the trees
behind the lids of my own eyes
nostalgias cool but it wont help me now
a dream is good dont wear it out if you dont wear it out

and im just a little bit caught in the middle
i try to keep going but its not that simple
i think im a little bit caught in the middle
gotta keep going or theyll call me a quitter
yeah im caught in the middle

no i dont need no help
i can sabotage me by myself
i dont need no one else
i can sabotage me by myself
i dont need no help
i can sabotage me by myself
dont need no one else
i can sabotage me by myself
i dont need no help
i can sabatoge me by myself
dont need no one else
i can sabotage me by myself
i dont need no help
i can sabatoge me by myself
dont need no one else
i can sabotage me by myself

and im just a little bit caught in the middle
i try to keep going but its not that simple
i think im a little bit caught in the middle
gotta keep going or theyll call me a quitter
yeah im caught in the middle
