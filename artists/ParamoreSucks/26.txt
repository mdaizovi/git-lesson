man you really know how to get someone down
everything was fine until you came around
and ive been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
after all wasnt i the one who said
to keep your feet on the ground
man you really brought me back down

hold onto hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
and they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me

you got me tied up but i stay close to the window
and i talk to myself about the places that i used to go
and hope that someday maybe i just float away
and forget every cynical thing you said
when you gonna hear me out
man you really bring me down

hold onto hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
and they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me

reality will break your heart
survival will not be the hardest part
its keeping all your hopes alive
all the rest of you has died
so let it break your heart

hold onto hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
hold onto hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
and they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me
