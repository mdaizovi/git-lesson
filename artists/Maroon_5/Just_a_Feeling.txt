i watched you cry
bathed in sunlight
by the bathroom door
you said you wished you did not love me anymore

you left your flowers in the backseat of my car
the things we said and did have left permanent scars
obsessed depressed at the same time
i cant even walk in a straight line
ive been lying in the dark no sunshine
no sunshine
no sunshine

she cries
this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes
youre not even there
its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
oh yeah

i cant believe that its over
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
youve hit your low
youve lost control and you want me back
you may not believe me but i gave you all i have
oh just confess that youre still mine
i roll around in a bed full of tears and
im still lying in the dark no sunshine
no sunshine
no sunshine

she cries this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes youre not even there

its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have

no i cant believe that its over now baby
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
so much to say
its not the way she does her hair
its the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
and in my darkest day when she refused to run away
the love she tried so hard to save

its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have

its just a feeling
its just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have

i cant believe that its over
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
i cant believe that its over
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
i cant believe that its over yeah
