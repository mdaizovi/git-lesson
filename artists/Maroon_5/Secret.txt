watch the sunrise
say your goodbyes
off we go
some conversation
no contemplation
hit the road

car overheats
jump out of my seat
on the side of the highway baby
our road is long
your hold is strong
please dont ever let it go oh no

i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cant

driving fast now
dont think i know how to go slow
where you at now
i feel around
there you are

cool these engines
calm these jets
i ask you how hot can it get
as you wipe off beads of sweat
slowly you say im not there yet

i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cant

i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cant
