can you see me
floating above your head
as you lay in bed
thinking about everything
that you did not do
cause saying i love you
has nothing to do with meaning it

and i dont trust you
cause every time youre here
your intentions are unclear
i spend every hour waiting for a phone call
that i know will never come
i used to think you were the one
now im sick of thinking anything at all

you aint ever coming back to me
thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that

do you remember
the way we used to melt
do you remember how it felt
when i touched you
cause i remember very well

and how long has it been
since someone you let in
has given when i gave to you

and at night when you sleep
do you dream i would be there
just for a minute or two
do you

you aint ever coming back to me
thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that

heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know im through with you
