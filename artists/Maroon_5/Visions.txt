i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you
i keep getting stuck in this day
stuck in this déjàvu

its like im never riding solo
i feel you walking in my shadow
never hit me quite like that though
cause now im under your spell
late nights and i cant sleep
choked up and i cant breathe
no one that can save me
cause now im under your spell

i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you
i keep getting stuck in this day
stuck in this déjàvu
even in my darkest hour
even when i know it cant be true
i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you

ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
i keep seeing visions of you

i keep saying that im okay
they never go
so i pray
dear lord i hope that one day
i get you out of my head
late nights and i cant sleep
choked up and i cant breathe
no one that can save me
cause now im under your spell

i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you
i keep getting stuck in this day
stuck in this déjàvu
even in my darkest hour
even when i know it cant be true
i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you

ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
i keep seeing visions of you

youre a mirage
its all in my mind
this is just love playing tricks on my eyes
youre a mirage
its all in my mind
why cant i seem to let go
youre a mirage
its all in my mind
this is just love playing tricks on my eyes
youre a mirage
its all in my mind
why cant i seem to let go

i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you
i keep getting stuck in this day
stuck in this déjàvu
even in my darkest hour
even when i know it cant be true
i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you

ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
i keep seeing visions of you

ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh
ooh ooh ohoh

i keep seeing visions of you
visions of visions of you
