i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore woah woah woah

i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied
oh kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again

but oh this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore woah woah woah

ill fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
and make sure everything is alright
my pressure on your hips
sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you
cause i know thats what you want me to do

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
my heart is breaking in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
