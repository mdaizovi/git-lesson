ive been the needle and the thread
weaving figure eights and circles around your head
i try to laugh but cry instead
patiently wait to hear the words youve never said

fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry

im lifting you up
im letting you down
im dancing till dawn
im fooling around
im not giving up
im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out

this is not goodbye she said
its just time for me to rest my head
she does not walk she runs instead
down these jagged streets and into my bed

when i was fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry

im lifting you up
im letting you down
im dancing till dawn
im fooling around
im not giving up
im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out

theres only so much i can do for you
after all of the things youve put me through

im lifting you up
im letting you down
im dancing till dawn
im fooling around
im not giving up
im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out
