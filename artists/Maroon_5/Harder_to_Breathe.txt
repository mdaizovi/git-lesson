how dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
so condescending unnecessarily critical
i have the tendency of getting very physical
so watch your step cause if i do youll need a miracle

you drain me dry and make me wonder why im even here
the double vision i was seeing is finally clear
you want to stay but you know very well i want you gone
not fit to fuckin tread the ground im walking on

chorus
when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe

what you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
you should know better you never listened to a word i said
clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
hoping somebody someday will do you like i did

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe

does it kill
does it burn
is it painful to learn
that its me that has all the control

does it thrill
does it sting
when you feel what i bring
and you wish that you had me to hold

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
