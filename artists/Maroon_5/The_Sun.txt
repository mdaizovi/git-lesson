after school
walking home
fresh dirt under my fingernails
and i can smell hot asphalt
cars screech to a halt to let me pass
and i cannot remember
what life was like through photographs
and trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

and sometimes its a sad song

but i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away
make every day
worth all of the pain that i have gone through
and mama ive been cryin
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun

oh whoa yeah

now moving on down my street
i see people i wont ever meet
i think of her and take a breath
feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

and sometimes its a sad song

but i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away
make every day
worth all of the pain that i have gone through
and mama ive been cryin
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun

the rhythm of her conversation
the perfection of her creation
the sex she slipped into my coffee
the way she felt when she first saw me
hate to love and love to hate her
like a broken record player
back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on

i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away
make every day
worth all of the pain that i have gone through
and mama ive been cryin
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles
said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun

yeah oh several miles from the sun oh
yeah yeah whoo whoa whoa yeah yeah
