what am i supposed to do with this time
it tears so many holes i stay afloat but im
feel out of control so petrified
im petrified

what am i supposed to do to get by
did i lose everything i need to survive
cause its 4 am and the sweat sets in
did you get my message did it send
or did you just get on with your life oh

ive taken time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling when i
finally found the words to say
but i cant tell you 
if you turn around and run away run away

what am i supposed to do with these clothes 
its my twisted way of keep you close
im a nervous wreck im a broken man
did you get my message did it send
or do you get along on your own oh

ive taken time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling when i
finally found the words to say
but i cant tell you 
if you turn around and run away run away

and it breaks me down when i see your face
you look so different but you feel the same
and i do not understand i cannot comprehend
the chills your body sends why did it have to end

ive taken time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling that i
finally found the words to say
but i cant tell you 
if you turn around and run away run away

ive taken time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
and i have this feeling that i
finally found the words to say
but i cant tell you 
if you turn around and run away run away

runaway runaway
turn around and runaway runaway
runaway runaway
but i cant tell you if you runaway runaway
turn around and runaway
