im full of regret
for all the things that i have done and said
and i dont know if itll ever be okay to show
my face round here
sometimes i wonder if i disappear

would you ever turn your head and look
to see if im gone
cause i fear

there is nothing left to say to you
that you want to hear
that you want to know
i think i should go
the things ive done are way too shameful

youre just an innocent
a helpless victim of a spiders web
and im an insect
going after anything that i can get
so youd better turn your head and run
and dont look back
cause i fear

there is nothing left to say to you
that you want to hear
that you want to know
i think i should go
the things ive done are way too shameful

and i have done you so wrong
treated you bad
strung you along
oh shame on myself
i dont know how i got so tangled up
cause i fear

there is nothing left to say to you
that you want to hear
that you want to know
i think i should go
the things ive done are way too shameful
