you build me up
you knock me down
provoke a smile
and make me frown
you are the queen of runaround
you know its true

you chew me up
and spit me out
enjoy the taste
i leave in your mouth
you look at me
i look at you
neither of us know what to do

there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess id better find a new way in
i shiver when i hear your name
think about you but its not the same
i wont be satisfied til im under your skin

immobilized by the thought of you
paralyzed by the sight of you
hypnotized by the words you say
not true but i believe em anyway

so come to bed its getting late
theres no more time for us to waste
remember how my body tastes
you feel you heart being to race

there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess id better find a new way in hey
i shiver when i hear your name
think about you but its not the same
i wont be satisfied till im under your skin 
yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess id better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you but its not the same
i wont be satisfied till im under your skin

there may not
be another way to your heart
so i guess id better find a new way in
and i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you but its not the same
i wont be satisfied till im under your skin yeah yeah yeah
