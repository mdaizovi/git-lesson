i must have been a fool
to love you so hard for so long
so much stronger than before
but so much harder to move on
and now the bitter chill of the winter
still blows through me like a plague
only to wake up with an empty bed
on a perfect summer day

my world just feels so cold
and you find yourself walking down
the wrong side of the road
ow

i cant lie your on my mind stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

i never did my best to express how i really felt
and now that i know exactly what i want
you found somebody else

ooh my world just feels so cold
and you find yourself walking on
the wrong side of the road
oh yeah

i cant lie your on my mind stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

ah la la la la la la la yeah
ah la la la la la la la yeah
ah la la la la la la la oh
ah la la la la la la la yeah

my world just feels so cold
and i find myself thinking about the things i could have done
and it warms my soul when you let me know
im not the only one

i cant lie your on my mind stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

i cant lie your on my mind stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

i cant lie your on my mind stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
