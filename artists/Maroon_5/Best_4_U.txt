yeah another night out
i get drunk i get high
then you call and i lie
and i say im on my way now
yeah i say im on my way now

show up when its lights out
when youre dressing for work
and im mumbling words
i dont know what to say now
no i dont know what to say now

you tell me i dont care
tell me i never try
i said im sorry
maybe a million times
its gonna hurt ya
if i dont say goodbye
you dont believe me
you dont believe me

i just want the best for you
i just want the best for you
but im just not the best for you
you dont want
what im gonna put ya through

what im gonna put ya through

parties with shots and powder
but you rather sleep eight hours
and i know you got your doubts
cause i cant turn this life around baby
thought it was just a phase
til i woke up a thousand days later
realizing im the same
as i was before i saw your face

you tell me i dont care
tell me i never try
i said im sorry
maybe a million times
its gonna hurt ya
if i dont say goodbye
you dont believe me
you dont believe me

i just want the best for you
i just want the best for you
but im not just the best for you
you dont want
what im gonna put ya through

i just want the best for you
but im not just the best for you
you dont want
what im gonna put ya through
