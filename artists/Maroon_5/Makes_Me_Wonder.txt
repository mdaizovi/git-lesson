i wake up with bloodshot eyes
struggled to memorize
the way it felt between your thighs
pleasure that made you cry
feels so good to be bad
not worth the aftermath after that
after that
try to get you back

i still dont have the reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder
if i ever gave a fck about you

give me something to believe in
cause i dont believe in you
anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to try
yeah so this is goodbye

god damn my spinning head
decisions that made my bed
now i must lay in it
and deal with things i left unsaid
i want to dive into you
forget what youre going through
i get behind make your move
forget about the truth

i still dont have the reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder
if i ever gave a fck about you

give me something to believe in
cause i dont believe in you
anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference
it even makes a difference to try yeah
and you told me how youre feeling
but i dont believe its true
anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
oh no
so this is goodbye

ive been here before
one day a week
and it wont hurt anymore
you caught me in a lie
i have no alibi
the words you say dont have a meaning
cause

i still dont have the reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder
if i ever gave a fck about you and i
and so this is goodbye

give me something to believe in
cause i dont believe in you
anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference
it even makes a difference to try
and you told me how youre feeling
but i dont believe its true
anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
oh no
so this is goodbye
so this is goodbye yeah
so this is goodbye yeah
