i have been searching for your touch
unlike any touch ive ever known

and i never thought about you much
till im broken down and all alone

no i dont understand the meaning of love
i do not mind if i die trying oh

took you for granted
when you lifted me up

im asking for your help
i am going through hell
afraid nothing can save me
but the sound of your voice

you cut out all the noise
and now that i can see mistakes so clearly now
id kill if i could take you back
but how
but how

i can feel it in my guts
whats going on with him now

dont patronize me with lies
ima man be a woman now

i have been bound by the shackles of love
and i dont mind if i die tied up

took you for granted
when you lifted me up

im asking for your help
i am going through hell
afraid nothing can save me
but the sound of your voice

you cut out all the noise
and now that i can see mistakes so clearly now
id kill if i could take you back
but how
but how
but how
but how

why must we be so ugly
and please do not speak ill of me
why does the one you love
become the one who makes you want to cry

and why
why
why

no i dont understand the meaning of love
i do not mind if i die trying
i do not mind if i die trying
i do not mind if i die trying
