leaves are fallin its september
the night came in and made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young til she kissed me
like a whiskey like a whiskey

i never knew that love was blind
til i was hers but she was never mine
yeah i was reckless
but i let it burn i let it burn yeah
the feeling it was bittersweet
realizing i was into deep
she was a lesson
i had to learn i had to learn yeah

i used to try to forget her
but now i smile when i remember

leaves are fallin its september
the night came in and made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young til she kissed me
like a whiskey like a whiskey whoa

wouldve left this world behind
just to wake up by your side
every mornin i
wouldve sold my soul for a little more time mmm
wouldve waited a thousand nights
if she never said goodbye
i admit that i
wouldve sold my soul for a little more time

i used to try to forget her
but now i smile when i remember oh

leaves are fallin its september
the night came in and made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young til she kissed me
like a whiskey like a whiskey

i aint like the other cognacs
or type of cat thatd never call back
or lose contact when you runnin out of rum and you make a run
feelin light and dizzy might be tipsy
all of that tequilas a killer little vodka
break her off somethin proper
pop a cork and play spin the bottle
every time you kiss me like some whiskey
punch drunk love its a fine line
dom p√©rignon she the fine wine
someone call 911 im runnin out of time
she done got off my heart

leaves are fallin its september woah
the night came in and made her shiver
i told her she could have my jacket
wrapped it tight around her shoulders
and i was so young so young
til she kissed me yeah
like a whiskey yeah
and i was so young so young
til she kissed me
like a whiskey like a whiskey
