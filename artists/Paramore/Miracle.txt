ive gone for too long
living like im not alive
so im gonna start over tonight
beginning with you and i

when this memory fades
im gonna make sure its replaced
with chances taken hope embraced
and have i told you

im not going
cause ive been waiting for a miracle
and im not leaving
i wont let you
let you give up on a miracle
when it might save you

weve learned to run from
anything uncomfortable
weve tied our pain below
and no one ever has to know

that inside were broken
i try to patch things up again
to calm my tears and kill these fears
but have i told you have i

im not going
cause ive been waiting for a miracle
and im not leaving
i wont let you
let you give up on a miracle
when it might save you

its not faith if
if you use your eyes
youll lie
well get it right this time this time
lets leave this all behind
oh i will get it right this time
its not faith if youre using your eyes
oh i

well ive gone for too long
living like im not alive
so im gonna start over tonight
beginning with you and

i dont want to run from
anything uncomfortable
i just want no
i just need this pain to end right here

im not going
cause ive been waiting for a miracle
and im not leaving
i wont let you
let you give up on a miracle
cause it might save you

yeah it might save you
oh it might save you
its not faith if you
if you use your eyes
if you use your eyes
if you use your eyes
