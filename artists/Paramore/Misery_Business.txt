im in the business of misery lets take it from the top
shes got a body like an hourglass thats ticking like a clock
its a matter of time before we all run out
when i thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth

i waited eight long months
she finally set him free
i told him i couldnt lie he was the only one for me
two weeks and we had caught on fire
shes got it out for me but i wear the biggest smile

chorus
whoa well i never meant to brag
but ive gotten what i wanted now
whoa it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
cause i got him where i want him now
and if you could then you know you would
cause god it just feels so
it just feels so good

second chances they dont ever matter people never change
once a whore youre nothing more im sorry thatll never change
and about forgiveness were both supposed to have exchanged
im sorry honey i passed out now look this way

well theres a million other girls who do it just like you
looking as innocent as possible to get to who
they want and what they like its easy if you do it right
well i refuse i refuse i refuse

chorus

i watched his wildest dreams come true
not one of them involving you
just watch my wildest dreams come true
not one of them involving

whoa well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now

chorus
