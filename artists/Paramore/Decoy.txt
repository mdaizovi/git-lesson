close your eyes and make believe this is where you want to be
forgetting all the memories try to forget love cause loves forgotten me
well hey hey baby its never too late pretty soon you wont remember a thing
and ill be distant the stars reminiscing
your hearts been wasted on me

youve never been so used as im using you abusing you
my little decoy
dont look so blue you shouldve seen right through
im using you my little decoy
my little decoy

live your life inside a dream
time is changing everything
forgetting all the memories
and im forced into you just cause youre into me
well hey hey baby its never too late
when im gone you wont remember a thing
but i cant stay and you know i wont wait
i was gone from the very first day

youve never been so used as im using you abusing you
my little decoy
dont look so blue you shouldve seen right through
im using you my little decoy

oh oh
im not sorry at all
not sorry at all not sorry no
i wont be sorry at all
not sorry at all not sorry no
id do it over again

dont look so blue my little decoy
you shouldve seen right through my little decoy
youve never been so used my little decoy
and so im using you my little decoy
