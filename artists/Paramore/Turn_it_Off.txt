i scraped my knees while i was praying
and found a demon in my safest haven seems like
its getting harder to believe in anything
then just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
i wanna know what itd be like
to find perfection in my pride
to see nothing in the light
ill turn it off
in all my spite
in all my spite
ill turn it off

and the worst part is
before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the free fall i will realize
im better off when i hit the bottom

the tragedy it seems unending
im watching everyone i looked up to break and bending
were taking shortcuts and false solutions
just to come out the hero
well i can see behind the curtain i can see yeah yeah
the wheels are cranking turning so on the way were working
towards a goal thats non existent
its not existent but we just keep believing

and the worst part is
before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the free fall i will realize
im better off when i hit the bottom

i wanna know what itd be like
to find perfection in my pride
to see nothing in the light
ill turn it off
in all my spite
in all my spite
ill turn it off
just turn it off

again
again

and the worst part is
before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the free fall i will realize
im better off when i hit the bottom

and the worst part is
before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the free fall i will realize
im better off when i hit the bottom
