i got a lot to say to you
yeah i got a lot to say
i noticed your eyes are always glued to me
keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

they taped over your mouth
scribbled out the truth with their lies
your little spies
they taped over your mouth
scribbled out the truth with their lies
your little spies

crush crush crush crush crush one two three four

nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
just the one two of us is counting on
that never happens i guess im dreaming again
lets be more than this

if you wanna play it like a game
come on come on lets play
cause id rather waste my life pretending
than have to forget you for one whole minute

rock and roll honey hey dont you know baby
were all alone now i need something to sing about
rock and roll honey hey dont you know baby
were all alone now give me something to sing about
