take this time to realize
that you always shut your eyes
in the midst of trial
and everything is always right
and i think that its time
this battle must be won
but you pushed it aside
pushed it aside
pretend that its gone

this circle never ends
and its time you
just face it dont pretend
that its over
this circle never ends
and its time you
just face it dont pretend
that its over
