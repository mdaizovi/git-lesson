strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off
i know youre shaking my hand like it is the first time
are we alright
are you recounting all my faults
and are you racking your brain just to find them all
could it be that ive changed or did you

stop asking why
why we had to waste so much time
well we just pick up pick up and start again
cause we cant keep holding on to grudges

time is a bastard i wont break my neck to get around it
but arent we so brave to give up a fight
and let the years go by without us
cause now i feel you by my side
and i dont even care if its been a while
i can feel that weve changed and were better this way

stop asking why
why we had to waste so much time
well we just pick up pick up and start again
cause we cant keep holding on to grudges

and if you wanna call me up or come over
come on well laugh till we cry
like we did when we were kids
cause we cant keep holding on to grudges

why did it take so long
why did it take so long
why did it take us so long to just let go
why did it take us so long to stop holding on

stop asking why
why we had to waste so much time
well we just pick up pick up and start again
cause we cant keep holding on to grudges

and if you wanna call me up or come over
come on well laugh till we cry
like we did when we were kids
cause we cant keep holding on to grudges
we cant keep keep holding on to grudges

could it be that ive changed or did you
