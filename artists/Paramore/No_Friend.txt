these old letters from years ago
i felt it was leading to a

when i wrote this
i may have been finally able to address how it feels

another brickred room another blacktop town
another misspelled band burning their own houses down
another pinebox tune to fill the cemetery day
another star a touch of orange over purgatory gray

another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
another song that runs too long god knows no one needs
more misguided ghosts more transparent hands
to drop a nickel in our basket and well do our riot dance

beneath another burning sky behind our painted lips
in scares of catatonic smilecovered anklebitten ships
so throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
as protection from the paperthin perfection you project on me

when this repetition ends behind the window shades
a semiconscious sorrow sleeping in the bed ive made
that most unrestful bed that most original of sins
and youll say thats what i get when i let ambitions win again

id hate to let you down so ill let the waters rise
and drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
back in a cast bitpart back when i felt most free
i had a butchers heart and no one thought they knew me

so before the regiment resumes before the dreaded sun appears
my drivers waiting so lets make one point crystal clear
you see a floodlit form i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine

youre no friend of mine
youre no friend of mine
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine
you see a floodlit form
i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine

i see myself in the reflection of peoples eyes
realising what they see may not be even close to the image i see in myself
and i hate i might actually be more afraid to let myself down
i feel like they know the story
i saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
twelve years ago i stood on the shore
jump in and grab the coat
and the river is rushing toward a waterfall
and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
i let go of the coat but the coat wont let go of me
in any case please let me know if theres more i can give you
if nothing comes of it then just know we are grateful
