i told him and to sick it
out of town with a dime to my name
said im done with all my fake friends
selfrighteous pawns in a losing game
got my bedroom right then woke you out
been a burden since the day i was born
so i cried just little then i dried my eyes
cause im not a little girl no more

some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind

certain life is so long as the picket
something i will never understand
im too tired of always being mad at the world
wont you just admit you dont care
lady i dont want your pity
so dont feel sorry for me
iâ€™ve got a lover would die for this song to sing
maybe were both just living out how i dream

some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind

we get along for the most part
me and reality the light in the dark
and we live alone
and two evil worlds
be in a fantasy
with you and your memories

but we get along
we get along for the most part
we get along yeah for the most part
we get along for the most part
we get along
we get along
we get along

some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind leave you behind

and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind
