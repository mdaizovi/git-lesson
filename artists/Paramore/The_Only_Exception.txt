when i was younger
i saw my daddy cry
and curse at the wind
he broke his own heart
and i watched
as he tried to reassemble it

and my momma swore that
she would never let herself forget
and that was the day that i promised
id never sing of love
if it does not exist

but darlin

you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

maybe i know somewhere
deep in my soul
that love never lasts
and weve got to find other ways
to make it alone
or keep a straight face

and ive always lived like this
keeping a comfortable distance
and up until now
i had sworn to myself that im content
with loneliness

because none of it was ever worth the risk but

you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

ive got a tight grip on reality
but i cant let go of whats in front of me here
i know your leaving in the morning when you wake up
leave me with some kind of proof its not a dream

oh oh oh

you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

and im on my way to believing
oh and im on my way to believing
