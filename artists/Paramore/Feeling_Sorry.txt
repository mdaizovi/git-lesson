we still live in the same town well dont we
but i dont see you around anymore
i go to all the same places not even a trace of you
your days are numbered at twenty four
and as im getting bored waiting round for you
were not getting any younger and i
wont look back cause theres no use
its time to move forward

i feel no sympathy
you live inside a cave
you barely get by the rest of us are trying
theres no need to apologize
ive got no time for feeling sorry

well i tried not to think of what might happen
when your reality it finally cuts through
well as for me i got out and im on the road
the worst part is that this this this could be you
you know it too you cant run from your shame
youre not getting any younger time
keeps passing by but you waited awake
its time to roll over

i feel no sympathy
you live inside a cave
you barely get by the rest of us are trying
theres no need to apologize
ive got no time for feeling sorry

and all the best lies
they are told with fingers tied
so cross them tight
wont you promise me tonight
if its the last thing you do youll get out

i feel no sympathy
you live inside a cave
you barely get by the rest of us
youre trying theres no need to apologize
ive got no time ive got no time

i feel no sympathy
you live inside a cave
you barely get by the rest of us
youre trying theres no need to apologize
got no time

ive got no time for feeling sorry
ive got no time for feeling sorry
