all that i want
is to wake up fine
tell me that im alright
that i aint gonna die
all that i want
is a hole in the ground
you can tell me when its alright
for me to come out

hard times gonna make you wonder why you even try
hard times gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
these lives and i still dont know how i even survive
hard times
hard times
and i gotta get to rock bottom

walking around
my little rain cloud
hanging over my head
and it aint coming down
where do i go
gimme some sort of sign
you hit me with lightning
maybe ill come alive

hard times gonna make you wonder why you even try
hard times gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
these lives and i still dont know how i even survive
hard times
hard times
and i gotta head to rock bottom

tell my friends im coming down
well kick it when i hit the ground
tell my friends im coming down
well kick it when i hit the ground
when i hit the ground
when i hit the ground
when i hit the ground
when i hit the ground

hard times gonna make you wonder why you even try
hard times gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
these lives and i still dont know how i even survive
hard times hard times
hard times hard times

hard times gonna make you wonder why you even try
hard times gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
these lives and i still dont know how i even survive
hard times hard times
hard times

and i gotta get to rock bottom
