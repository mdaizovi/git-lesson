what a shame we all became such fragile broken things
a memory remains just a tiny spark
i give it all my oxygen to let the flames begin
to let the flames begin

oh glory
oh glory

this is how well dance when
when they try to take us down
this is what well be oh glory

somewhere weakness is our strength and ill die searching for it
i cant let myself regret such selfishness
my pain and all the trouble caused no matter how long
i believe that theres hope

buried beneath it all and
hiding beneath it all and
growing beneath it all and

this is how well dance when
when they try to take us down
this is how well sing oh
this is how well stand when
when they burn our houses down
this is what well be oh glory

reaching as i sink down into light to light
reaching as i sink down into light to light

this is how we dance when
when they try to take us down
this is how well sing oh
this is how well stand when
when they burn our houses down
this is what well be oh glory
