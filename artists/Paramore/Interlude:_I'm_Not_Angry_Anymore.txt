i’m not angry anymore
well sometimes i am
i don’t think badly of you
well sometimes i do

it depends on the day
the extend of all my worthless rage
i’m not angry anymore

i’m not bitter anymore
i’m syrupy sweet
i rot your teeth down to the core
if i’m really happy

it depends on the day
if i wake up in a giddy haze
well i’m not angry
i’m not totally angry
i’m not all that angry anymore
