tell me where our time went
and if it was time well spent
just dont let me fall asleep
feeling empty again

cause i fear i might brake
and i fear i cant take it
tonight ill lie awake
feeling empty i can

feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

now that im losing hope
and theres nothing else to show
for all of the days that we spent
carried away from home

some things ill never know
and i had to let them go
im sitting all alone
feeling empty i can

feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

some things ill never know and i had to let them go

some things ill never know
and i had to let them go
but im sitting all alone
feeling empty

i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

feel the pressure
its getting closer now
youre better off without me
