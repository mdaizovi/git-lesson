you were my conscience so solid now youre like water
we started drowning not like wed sink any further
but i let my heart go its somewhere down at the bottom
but ill get a new one and come back for the hope that youve stolen

ill stop the whole world ill stop the whole world
from turning into a monster and eating us alive
dont you ever wonder how we survive
well now that your gone the world is ours

im only human ive got a skeleton in me
but im not the villain despite what youre always preaching
call me a traitor im just collecting your victims
theyre getting stronger i hear them calling

ill stop the whole world ill stop the whole world
from turning into a monster and eating us alive
dont you ever wonder how we survive
well now that your gone the world is ours

well you find your strength in solutions
but i liked the tension
and not always knowing the answers
but youre gonna lose it youre gonna lose it

ill stop the whole world ill stop the whole world
from turning into a monster and eating us alive
dont you ever wonder how we survive
well now that your gone the world

ill stop the whole world ill stop the whole world
from turning into a monster eating us alive
dont you ever wonder how we survive
now that your gone the world is ours
