let em have their time
sit back and let em shine
let em rise and rise
cause one day theyre gonna fall

let em soak in the sun
sit back and let em have their fun
let em spill their guts
cause one day theyre gonna slip on em

well i could be angry but youre not worth a fight
and besides im moving on
ive counted to ten and im feeling alright
and besides im moving on

let em play their songs
let em say whats right and wrong
let em do their thing
cause itll never be you and me

we got our own style
we got a way of living life
if they cant get down
well we dont need them around

well i could be angry but youre not worth a fight
and besides im moving on
ive counted to ten and im feeling alright
and besides im moving
yes im moving
besides im moving on
