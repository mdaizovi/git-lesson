if im a bad person you dont like me
well i guess ill make my own way
its a circle a mean cycle
i cant excite you anymore
wheres your gavel your jury
whats my offense this time
youre not a judge but if youre gonna judge me
well sentence me to another life

dont wanna hear your sad songs
i dont wanna feel your pain
when you swear its all my fault
cause you know were not the same
hey
were not the same
no
oh were not the same
yeah but we used to stick together
we wrote our names in blood
hey
but i guess you cant accept that the change is good
its good its good

well you treat me just like another stranger
well its nice to meet you sir
i guess ill go
i best be on my way out
you treat me just like another stranger
well its nice to meet you sir
i guess ill go
i best be on my way out

ignorance is your new best friend
ignorance is your new best friend

and this is the best thing that could have happened
any longer and i wouldnt have made it
its not a war no its not a rapture
im just a person but you cant take it
the same tricks that that once fooled me
they wont get you anywhere
im not the same kid from your memory
well now i can fend for myself

dont wanna hear your sad songs
i dont wanna feel your pain
when you swear its all my fault
cause you know were not the same
hey
were not the same
hey

yeah we used to stick together
we wrote our names in blood
but i guess you cant accept that the change is good
its good its good
