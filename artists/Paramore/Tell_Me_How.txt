i cant call you a stranger
but i cant call you
i know you think that i erased you
you may hate me but i cant hate you
and i wont replace you

tell me how to feel about you now
tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know
do i suffocate or let go

think im tired of getting over it
just starting something new again
im getting sick of the beginnings
and always coming to your defences
i guess its good to get it off my chest
i guess i cant believe i havent yet
you know i got my own convictions
and theyre stronger than any addiction
but no ones winning

tell me how to feel about you now
tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know
do i suffocate or let go
tell me how to feel about you now
tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know
do i suffocate or let go

you keep me up with your silence
take me down with your quiet
of all the weapons you fight with
your silence is the most violent

tell me how to feel about you now
tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know
do i suffocate or let go
tell me how to feel about you now
tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know
do i suffocate or let go

you dont have to tell me
if you ever think of me
i know you say youre busy
wildly in the fog of your memory
you dont have to tell me i can still believe
