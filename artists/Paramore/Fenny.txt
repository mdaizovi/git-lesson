im sitting in a room
made up of only big white walls
and in the halls
there are people looking through the window and the door
they know exactly what were here for
dont look up just let them think
theres no place else youd rather be

youre always on display
for everyone to watch and learn from
dont you know by now
you cant turn back
because this road is all youll ever have

and its obvious that youre dying dying
just living proof that the cameras lying
and oh oh open wide
cause this is your night so smile
cause youll go out in style
youll go out in style

if you let me i could
id show you how to build your fences
set restrictions
separate from the world
the constant battle that you hate to fight
just blame the limelight

dont look up just let them think
theres no place else youd rather be in now
you cant turn back
because this road is all youll ever have

and its obvious that youre dying dying
just living proof that the cameras lying
and oh oh open wide
cause this is your night so smile

yeah yeah youre asking for it
with every breath that you breathe in
just breathe it in
yeah yeah well youre just a mess
you do all this big talking
so now lets see you walking
i said lets see you walking

yeah yeah well youre just a mess
you do all this big talking
so now lets see you walking
i said lets see you walking

and its obvious that youre dying dying
just living proof that the cameras lying
and oh oh open wide
yeah oh oh open wide
yeah oh oh open wide
cause youll go out in style
youll go out in style
