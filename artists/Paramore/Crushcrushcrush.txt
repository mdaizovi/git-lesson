i got a lot to say to you
yeah i got a lot to say
i noticed your eyes are always glued to me
keeping them here
and it makes no sense at all

they taped over your mouth
scribbled out the truth with their lies
you little spies
they taped over your mouth
scribbled out the truth with their lies
you little spies

crush
crush
crush
crush crush
two three four

chorus
nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
just the onetwo of us whos counting on
that never happens
i guess im dreaming again
lets be more than this

if you want to play it like a game
well come on come on lets play
cause id rather waste my life pretending
than have to forget you for one whole minute

they taped over your mouth
scribbled out the truth with their lies
you little spies
they taped over your mouth
scribbled out the truth with their lies
you little spies

crush
crush
crush
crush crush
two three four

chorus

rock and roll baby
dont you know that were all alone now
i need something to sing about
rock and roll hey
dont you know baby were all alone now
we need something to sing about
rock and roll hey
dont you know baby were all alone now
give me something to sing about
