what a shame what a shame we all remain
such fragile broken few
a beauty have the trade butterflies with punctured wings
still there are darkened glimpses deep in my heart
what once was blazing like now there’s a tiny scar

oh glory come and find me
oh glory come and find me

dancing all alone
to the sound of an enemy’s song
i’ll be lost until you find me
fighting on my own
in a war that’s already been won
i’ll be lost until you come and find me here oh glory
here

what a mess what a mystery we’ve made
put loving in the simple things
loving to forgive
even when it was an odd mistake
i question every human who won’t look in my eyes
scars left on my heart formed buttons in my mind

oh glory you will find me

dancing all alone
to the sound of an enemy’s song
i’ll be lost until you find me
fighting on my own
in a war that’s already been won
i’ll be lost until you come and find me here oh glory

like the moon we borrow our light
i am nothing but a shadow in the night
so if you let me i will catch fire
to let your glory and mercy shine
