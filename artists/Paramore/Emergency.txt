i think we have an emergency
i think we have an emergency
if you thought id leave you then you were wrong
cause i wont stop holding on

so are you listening
so are you watching me
if you thought id breathe then you were wrong
because i wont stop holding on

this is an emergency so are you listening
and i cant pretend that i dont see this
its really not your fault
and no one cares to talk about it to talk about it

cause ive seen love die way too many times
when it deserved to be alive it deserved to be alive
ive seen you cry way too many times
when you deserved to be alive alive

so you give up every chance you get
just to feel new again
i think we have an emergency
i think we have an emergency

and you do your best to show me love
but you dont know what love is
so are you listening
so are you watching me

well i cant pretend that i dont see this
its really not your fault
and no one cares to talk about it
to talk about it

cause ive seen love die way too many times
when it deserved to be alive it deserved to be alive
and ive seen you cry way too many times
when you deserved to be alive alive

the scars they will not fade away

no one cares to talk about it
to talk about it

cause ive seen love die way too many times
when it deserved to be alive it deserved to be alive
and ive seen you cry way too many times
when you deserved to be alive alive
alive
