now i can move on to facing
big girl problems no more
high school drama
graduated with honors

and i’m drinking coffee while i
read the paper i’ve been
saving money
eating only top ramen

now i get a holiday
wherever i go i must stay
i don’t plan on coming back
ever if i can hold back

now i get a holiday
think i’ll stay
holiday
i’ll stay
