somewhere too far for us to find
forgotten the taste and smell
of a world that shes left behind

the angles were all wrong now
shes ripping wings off of butterflies

and well dig a deep hole
to bury the castle bury the castle

coiled up on the dirty ground
her prince finally came to save her
and the rest she can figure out
but it was a trick
and the clock struck twelve

or the wolfs gonna blow it down
keep your feet on the ground
when your heads in the clouds
