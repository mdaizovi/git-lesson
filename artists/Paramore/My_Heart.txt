i am finding out that maybe i was wrong
that ive fallen down and i cant do this alone
stay with me
this is what i need please

will you sing us a song
and well sing it back to you
we could sing our own
but what would it be without you

i am nothing now
and its been so long
since ive heard a sound
the sound of my only hope
this time i will be listening

will you sing us a song
and well sing it back to you
we could sing our own
but what would it be without you

this heart it beats
beats for only you

my heart is yours
