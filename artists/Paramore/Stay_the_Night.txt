so hold your tongue and hear me out
i know that we were made to break so what i dont mind

dont dull the sparkle in your eyes
i know that we were made to break so what i dont mind

doesnt mean were bound for life
so oh oh oh are you gonna stay the night

well let this place go down in flames only one more time

you kill the lights ill draw the blinds
dont dull the sparkle in your eyes
i know that we were made to break
so what i dont mind
