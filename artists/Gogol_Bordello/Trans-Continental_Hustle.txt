old schools they were just nomadic forces
kill all the men steal all the women and the horses
then later on moved on to the pursuit of spices
and finally the rest of all devices

but in the wake of the transcontinental hustle
governing cloak it went up in flames
and by the time we builded up the muscle
there was no time or space left to claim

whoaho whoaho whoohohwhoaho
whoaho whoaho whoohohwhoaho
iglesia de la calla transcontinentau
cigano urbano maracatu rurau
samba

we gonna build new kind of globalizer
without the pantzerfoust or a shmiser
and may the sound of our contaminated beat
sweep all the nazi purists off their feet

hey hey hey hey hali hali ho hali hali hey

crosspollination is on the way
yes its on the way yes its on the way
hey hey hey hey hali hali ho hali hali hey
crosspollination hali ho is on the way
