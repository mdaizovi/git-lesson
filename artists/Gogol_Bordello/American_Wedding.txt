have you ever been to american wedding
where is the vodka where is marinated herring
where is the musicians that got the taste
wheres the supply thats gonna last three days
wheres the band that like fanfare gonna keep it going 24 hour

instead its 1 in the morning and djs patching up the chords
everybodys full of cake staring at the floor
proper couples start to mumble that its time to go
people gotta get up early and they gotta go

ah people gotta get up early and shes got a boyfriend
and this whole fucking thing is one huge disappointment
and nothing gets these bitches going not even gypsy kings
nobody talks about my super theory of super everything

so be donald trump or be an anarchist
make sure that your wedding doesnt end up like this

i understand the cultures of a different kind
but here word celebration just doesnt come to mind

have you ever been to american wedding
where is the vodka where is marinated herring
where is the musicians that got the taste
wheres the supply thats gonna last three days
wheres the band that like fanfare gonna keep it going 24 hour
