you know
its time for a change
but how
and where do you start

when bitching
and moaning
and frowning
and groaning
and loathing
and throwing
has torn you apart

it has torn you apart
from deep within
left no vigorous cell
even in eden you seek knothole to hell

oh hey hey
ho ho
captain crooked grin
tell me where you trying to go

you taught your parrot to stutter
now you repeat his old chatter
but it is the way you name your ship
thats the way its going to row
oh
its the way you name your ship
thats the way its going to row

now in the beginning there was a word
in the end there is no end
people dont live or die
people just fade in and out of the fog
we come to comprehend

and now all alone with your crooked grin
how you plan staying afloat
even the boatsman grab bible
and split from the boat

oh hey hey
ho ho
captain crooked grin
tell us where you trying to go

you taught your parrot to stutter
now you believe his old chatter
but it is the way you name your ship
thats the way its going to row

its the way you name your ship
thats the way its going to row

row

you taught your parrot to stutter
now youre slave to his chatter
but it is the way you name your ship
thats the way its going to row
oh
its the way you name your ship
thats the way its going to row
oh
its the way you name your ship
thats exactly how its going to row
