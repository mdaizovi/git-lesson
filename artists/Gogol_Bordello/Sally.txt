sally was a fifteen year old girl from nebraska
gypsies were passing through her little town
they dropped something on the road she picked it up
and cultural revolution right away begun

oh no cultural revolution just begun
oh no cultural revolution just begun all right

they always were afraid that i was schizophrenic
they always were afraid schto ja rodinu prodam
a po pravde ja bil prosto malenkij medvedik
spizdil vsjo you vseh i vsjo nahuj proebal

oh no cultural revolution just begun
oh no cultural revolution just begun all right

from all the tables of contents that mother earth provides
id like to be a big fat fucking fly
the one that spins around your head all day and all night
and sound of it is just like a what
but by the accident of some kind divine dispensation
i ended up being a walking united nation
and i survived even fucking radiation

a big fat fucking what
and i would visit you a lot
