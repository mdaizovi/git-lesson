by the desperate n confused
emotion of the youth
i was brought to crisis land
where after getting checked for fleas
and barricades of embassies
i was sculpted to be overworked and silent

but since the early age
i broke out of the cage
and learned how to make marching drums from fish can
and i knew ill run away
and so without further delay
i said two tears in a bucket motherfuck it
and it seems like i ran and ran
through the garbage and quicksand
and after getting checked for fleas
and barricades of embassies
i would never never never wanna be young again

so
but sudden wind it stole my hat
and i went on chasing it
before i was just another burned out carnie
every freak on every day
lives a life one certain way
and that way is aint no nothin but a birthright
