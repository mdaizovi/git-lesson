we stepped together in the river
we traded fever on turmoil
last time i saw you was in the middle
i wonder if you hit the soil

where are you now my companjera
your baby claw stuck in my chest
where are you now my sonidera
who took you from the nest

where are you now my companjera
im beating bricks from town to town
where are you now my sonidera
im at my final down down
my final down

right through the muzzle came my surrender
i had to tear it off my mind
then hypothermia took over
and suddenly i went blind

where are you now my companjera
your baby claw stuck in my chest
where are you now my sonidera
who took you from the nest

where are you now my companjera
im beating bricks from town to town
where are you now my sonidera
im at my final down down
my final down

eat and sleep without desire
would you like window or aisle
oh miss sky you ever seen
warrior thats more fragile

jetlag hangover malnutrition
you cant fly in this condition
and if no one intervene
out of the window is my mission

where are you now my companjera
your baby claw stuck in my chest
where are you now my sonidera
who took you from the nest

where are you now my companjera
im beating bricks from town to town
where are you now my sonidera
im at my final down down
my final down
