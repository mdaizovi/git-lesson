my birth i can hardly remember
but i remember from the start
my midwives looking at each other
wow this boy is born with singing heart

all doors for him will now fly open
for everybody loves a nut
its true once they threw me in trenches
front line amigos sure love that

those midwives were like politicians
to bickering they were so proud
one said life is beautiful gift boy
other one said government loan

i still dont know which one is right girl
and you know i dont really care
i got to keep my heart asinging
and for that anything ill dare

oh for that anything anything ill dare
