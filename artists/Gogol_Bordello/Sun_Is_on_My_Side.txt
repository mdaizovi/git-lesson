what was here now is gone
up and down like everyone
walk the earth in lonesome cry
but when the sun comes up
when the sun comes up
it will be on your side
it will be on your side

to the song of wheels
all demons die
rays of joy they multiply
harmony you will be my bride
but when the sun comes up
ill let out last breath
and slumber softly
into the death

my half breed odyssey
your orphan prophecy
our destiny we will not hide
when the sun comes up
when the sun comes up
it will be on your side
it will be on our side

when the sun comes up
ill let out last breath
and ill slumber softly
into the death
