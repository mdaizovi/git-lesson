dont believe them for a moment
for a second do not believe my friend
when you are down them are not coming
with a helping hand
of course there is no us and them
but them they do not think the same
its them who do not think the same
its them who do not think

they never step on spiritual path
they paint their faces so differently from ours
and if you listen closely
that war it never stops
that war it never stops
that war 

be them new romans
dont envy them my friend
be their lives longer
oh their longer lives are spent
without a love or faithful friend
all those things they have to rent
yeah all those things they have to rent
all those things 

but we who see our destiny
in sound of this same old punk song
let rest originality for sake of passing it around
illuminating realization number one
you are the only light there is
for yourself my friend
you are the only light there is
for yourself my friend
for yourself my friend
for yourself my friend

therell be no saviors any soon coming down
and anyway illuminations
never come from the crowned
illuminating realization number one
you are the only light there is
for yourself my friend
you are the only light there is
for yourself my friend

but we who see our destiny
in sound of this same old punk song
let rest originality for sake of passing it around
illuminating realization number one
you are the only light there is
for yourself my friend
you are the only light there is
for yourself my friend
for yourself my friend
for yourself my friend
for yourself my friend
for yourself my friend
