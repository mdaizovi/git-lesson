you and i resemble god

made by him to come after him

everything in us resembles god

except for one thing



everything in us resembles god

except for one thing

everything in us resembles god

except for one thing



i am a liar you are a cheater

i am a theif and you are a traitor

im downright stupid

and you are paranoid

haha theres more than one



well lets just keep going then



when i screw

i dont care for the beauty

i drape myself over hands that are crooked



when im hurting myself

i just try to hurt you

you respond with tears

but they are never true



and as we tremble

night gets thinner and thinner

tell me which one of us here

is golden metal



golden metal of that heavenly road 

that ive heard is laying

somewhere in this world



one day 

one thing

one thing



and as we tremble

night gets thinner and thinner

tell me which one of us here

is golden metal



im paranoid

and you are downright stupid

i know youd flick me off

but your finger is too crooked



when im hurting myself

i just try to hurt you

you respond with tears

but they are never true



you and i resemble god

made by him to come after him

everything in us resembles god

except one thing



you and i resemble god

made by him to come after him

everything in us resembles god

except one thing

one thing

one thing

one thing

except for one thing

one thing



everything in us

resembles god

except for one thing

everything in us 

resembles god

except for one thing
