my strange uncles from abroad
yes i never metem
but i took everything they wrote
and ill never forget em
through the mystical communication
deep within it all comes through
forming underground railroad
for our ultimate breakthrough
my strange nephews from abroad
maybe ill never meet em
theyll take everything i wrote and id never forbid em
my strange uncles from beyond
ill meet em on the cosmos street
and we will drink to how we told
to never trust a plastic beat
through the mystical communication
deep within it all comes through
forming underground railroad
for our ultimate break through
