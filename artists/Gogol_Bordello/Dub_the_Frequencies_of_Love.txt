give me a vision when i got none
and the thunderbolts in each hand of my own
for im comin back to level
everythin they taught us wrong
onto transmigration

with a crave for panacea
our world is crawlin on all fours
in a search of a new prayer
gods are throwin thunderbolts

so dub it like tovarisch would
dub it like a best friend would
dub it like a brother would
onto transmigration

incomprehensible how to keep goin
of walkin trails of ultimate
from the streets to the subconscience
from subconscience to the god

so dub it like tovarisch would
dub it like a best friend would
dub it like a brother would
onto transmigration

frequencies of love
gather round oh come on
frequencies of love
overcome overthrow

master tell me how come everythin they taught us
turn out to be so goddamn wrong
in the meantime music from the tiny island
takes over the world

so dub it like tovarisch could
say it like a brother would
brother hold me like a mother would
onto transmigration

frequencies of love
gather round oh come on
frequencies of love
overcome overthrow

give me a vision when i got none
and the thunderbolts in each hand of my own
for im comin back to level
everythin they taught us wrong

dub it like tovarisch would
and say it like a brother would
dub it like tovarisch would
onto transmigration

frequencies of love
gather round oh come on
frequencies of love
overcome overthrow

onto transmigration
