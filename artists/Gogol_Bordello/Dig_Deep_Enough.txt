who would know better than us pleasure seekers
than to meet inside of the shamanic speakers
where past is a memory future is an illusion
where only the power of now
beats the confusion

we who seek long enough
dig deep enough
stay strong enough
the way

we who seek long enough
dig deep enough
find diamonds in the rough
one day today

who would know better than us freedom fighters
how to reach deep within to all igniters
where all of the feelings you could never explain
are coming to rescue from primordial brain

we who seek long enough
dig deep enough
stay strong enough
the way

we who seek long enough
dig deep enough
find diamonds in the rough
one day fck today

we are the youths without youth problems
cause we are the youths without youth problems
only the ones who get to reach stratosphere
get to see the sun
when its rainin down here

wo yo ho ho
wo yo ho ho
wo yo ho ho
the way
wo yo ho ho
wo yo ho ho
wo yo ho ho
the way
wo yo ho ho
wo yo ho ho
wo yo ho ho
one day
