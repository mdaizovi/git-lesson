when theres a trap set up for you
in every corner of this town
and so you learn the only way to go is underground
when theres a trap set up for you
in every corner of your room
and so you learn the only way to go is through the roof

ooohoohoooh through the roof underground

and as were crossing border after border
we realize that difference is none
its underdogs who and if you want it
you always have to make your own fun

and as the upperdog leisurely sighing
the local cultures are dying and dying
the programmed robots are buying and buying
and a psycho load of freaks they are still trying trying

ooohoohoooh through the roof underground

and as the boy scouts learn to read between the lines
the silver rabbits hop between their fathers lies
and boy scouts ask where where do they go
they go to the country that they only know

just like their meanings they lay between the lines
between the borders their real countries hide
the strategigos saw their advertise
their strategy of being is one of inyourface disguise

ooohoohoooh through the roof underground

and when their own walls they will acrumble
and all the systems will be discumbumbled
around the stump of bigotry our own ukrainian

ooohoohoooh through the roof underground
ooohoohoooh through the roof and underground
ooohoohoooh through the roof underground
ooohoohoooh through the roof underground

ukrainian

through the roof and underground
through the roof underground
