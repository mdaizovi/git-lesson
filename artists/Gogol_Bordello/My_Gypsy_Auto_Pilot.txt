i came back to my hometown incognito
to forget about it all
suddenly i heard hey there papitopitopito
you dont ever give a call

whapba bup bup ba
whapba bup bup ba
whapba bup bup ba
whapba bup bup ba

remember we used to skip school together
said to me drunk girl police man
now where have you been all my life
ive been skipping school since then yeah

ive been watching trains
swiftly rolling by
ive been jumping them
without long goodbyes
to uncover rules of life
and how to break them well
and the key to my gypsy auto pilot
and my story to tell hey

whapba bup bup ba
whapba bup bup ba
whapba bup bup ba
whapba bup bup ba

so we ran to outskirts of our town
to the working man dance hall
where all night we played pianoyanoyano
off the chairs about to fall
then we climbed the ladder to the attic
where once i showed her my first song
above the street where all them crazy dreamers
still talking nonsense all night long

whoao whoao
nonsense all night long
whoao whoao
still writing their first song

ive been watching trains
swiftly rolling by
ive been jumping them
without long goodbyes
to uncover rules of life
and how to break them well
and the key to my gypsy auto pilot
and my story to tell hey

and we laugh and we cry
and we recited sacred text
and we rose and we fell
and then we said ok whats next

but if you keep on watching trains
swiftly rolling by
one day you will be gone
without long goodbyes
to uncover rules of life
and how to break them well
and the key to your gonzo turbo gypsy auto pilot
and your story to tell
story to tell
