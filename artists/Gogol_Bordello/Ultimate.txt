if we are here not to do
what you and i wanna do
and go forever crazy with it
why the hell are we even here

there was never any good old days
they are today they are tomorrow
its a stupid thing we say
cursing tomorrow with sorrow

when we stand here in a row
looking like a bunch of heroes
i know that a deep inside
nothing more but bunch of zeros

skolko utetchki tepla
vot takaja vot subda
nam segodnja suzdena
a bti mezget chto kogda daj povezet

there was never any good old days
they are today they are tomorrow
its a stupid thing we say
cursing tomorrow with sorrow

steppin on the trail of ultimate
i would never choose to die
give me the rest of all the secrets
give me new culture of life

ultimate
ultimate
ultimate
ultimate
ultimate
