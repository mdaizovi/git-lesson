were miles apart
but safe from dreams
youre running from
beyond the dawn
well always need
one of their own
to lead

shine your light over me
shine your light over me
all of my fears are gone
all of my fears are gone baby gone gone
and it dont bother me
it dont bother me dont bother me now
if its not meant to be

too far to run
fall on your knees
to find a love
youre light for me
my only sun
youll always shine
for me

shine your light over me
shine your light over me
all of my fears are gone
all of my fears are gone baby gone gone
and it dont bother me
dont bother me dont bother me now
if its not meant to be

shine your light over me
shine your light over me shine on me
all of my fears are gone
all of my fears are gone baby gone gone
and it dont bother me
it dont bother me dont bother me now
if its not meant to be

i had to lose to understand
strung out from all this
pour out a thousand tears
i never knew a kinder man

a mile apart even if were 
a mile apart even if were 
a mile apart even if were 
a mile apart even if were 
a mile apart even if were 
a mile apart even if were 
a mile apart even if were
