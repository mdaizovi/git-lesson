honey i’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout you
all that you do
don’t you finger me too
lady where you’ve been for so long
i don’t need you no more
had to write you this song

well i long to be alone with you
and if i couldn’t have you 
i dont know what i would do
i guess i would leave i would leave
this world alone this world alone
cause without you i’m just bones bones

well i dream of you so much
love you so much
thoughts at large
well i speak only of you
so what else is new
what am i to do

well i long to be alone with you
and if i couldn’t have you 
i dont know what i would do
i guess i would leave i would leave
this world alone this world alone
cause without you i’m just bones bones

days go more and more i see
that your love is all my soul needs
that you’re gone and now i’m fallin’
fallin’ to my knees

well i long to be alone with you
and if i couldn’t have you 
i dont know what i would do
well i long to be alone with you
and if i couldn’t have i dont know
what i would do
i guess i would leave i would leave
this world alone this world alone
cause without you i’m just bones bones
i guess i would leave i would leave
this world alone this world alone
cause without you i’m just bones bones
i guess i would leave i would leave
this world alone this world alone
cause without you i’m just bones
