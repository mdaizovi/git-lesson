home again
home again
one day i know
ill feel home again
born again
born again
one day i know
ill feel strong again

i left my head
many times ive been told
all this talk will make you old
so i close my eyes
look behind
moving on moving on
so i close my eyes
look behind
moving on

lost again
lost again
one day i know
our paths will cross again
smile again
smile again
one day i hope
to make you smile again
i wont hide

many times ive been told
speak your mindjust be bold
so i close my eyes
look behind
moving on moving on
so i close my eyes
and the tears will clear
then i feel no fear
then id feel no way
my paths will remain straight

home again
home again
one day i know
ill feel home again
home again
home again
one day i know
ill feel strong again

i left my head
many times ive been told
all this talk will make you old
so i close my eyes
look behind
moving on moving on
so i close my eyes
look behind
moving on
