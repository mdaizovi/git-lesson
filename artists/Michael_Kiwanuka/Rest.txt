close your eyes 
let them rest 
i aint in no hurry hurry at all 
rest your head upon my shoulder 
i swear i will carry carry you on 

i wont let you go go on hungry 
i wont let you cry without a hand to dry 

rest your hands 
leave them tender 
they werent made for working working at all 

i wont let you go go on hungry 
i wont let you cry without a hand to dry 

rest your soul live in peace 
i wont let you worry worry at all 

i wont let you worry worry at all 
i wont let you worry worry at all
