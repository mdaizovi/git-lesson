uh when i leave dont you cry
when im getting on the lucky side
who will leave me alone

uh when ive passed dont you cry
when im long and gone will i decide
who will leave you alone

just you live your everyday like youre running out of time
say the things you say dont leave everything behind
try to find new somethings that wont fade away in time
these are things ill always see on your side

oh when im lost dont you cry
when ive gone away will at his side
who will leave me alone

uh when im sleeping dont you cry
when i close my eyes without your side
who will leave you alone

just you live your everyday like youre running out of time
say the things you say dont leave everything behind
try to find new somethings that wont fade away in time
these are things ill always see on your side

try to find new somethings that wont fade away in time
