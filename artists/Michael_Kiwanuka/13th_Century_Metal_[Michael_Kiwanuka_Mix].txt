i promise to think before i speak
to be wary of who i give my energy to
because it is needed for a greater cause
greater than my own pride
and that cause is to spread the enlightenment
of love compassion and humanity
to those who are not touched by its light
i stand to protect and focus myself
in the betterment of my fellow being
we are brothers and sisters each and every one
i promise to love my enemy
and never become that which is not god
i dedicate my spirit in the service
of what is good and fair and righteous
every day i am alive
i am given opportunities to become that which i admire most of others
i am nonviolent
i am a master student and my spirit
will never be stomped out
i am dedicated to oppose those whose will is to divide us
and who are determined to keep us in the dark ages of fear
i hear the voices of the unheard
speak for those who cannot speak
and shelter the minds that carry a message
of peace love and prosperity
i repeat we are all brothers and sisters
i repeat we are all brothers and sisters
i repeat we are all brothers and sisters
we are all brothers and sisters
we are all brothers and sisters
we are all brothers and sisters
we we
we we us us
