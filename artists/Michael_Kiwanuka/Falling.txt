right or wrong weve been through it all
cant believe its over now
understand that youll love again
word my friends say to me
on my own all my hope is gone
i dig my knees into the ground
oh i know its so hard to see
look what you done to me

im falling
im falling
im falling again
im falling
im falling
im falling again

i dont know why i stayed so long
i always knew youd let me down
im the man who belongs alone
thought that was plain to see
now youve come back into the fold
youre telling me you want me now
let me go leave my head alone
look what youve done to me

were falling
were falling
were falling again
were falling
were falling
were falling again

babe were falling
only falling
lord were falling again
babe were falling
oh were falling
so far were falling
were falling again
