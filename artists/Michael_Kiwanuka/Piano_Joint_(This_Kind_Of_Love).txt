walking down the avenue
looking out for something new
its the right time to give in
the right time to lose
to begin again
maybe win again

all i want is to talk to you
turn me onto something true
i cant be with another
although ive been used
i wont leave again
help me to the end

all i know is
my oh my this kind of love
its taken me from my enemies
dont let the pressure get to me
my oh my its bad enough
could you stay with me
dont let me go
sadness and fury is all i know

youve taken from my enemies
i still let the pressure get to me

i thought i could break away
i hope i fall in love today
no more heartbreak and trouble
and though ive been bruised
let me in again
i could use a friend

all i know is
my oh my this kind of love
its taken me from my enemies
dont let the pressure get to me
my oh my its bad enough
could you stay with me
dont let me go
sadness and fury is all i know

youve taken me from my enemies
i still let the pressure get to me
