standing now
calling all the people here to see the show
calling for my demons now to let me go
i need something give me something wonderful

i believe
she wont take me somewhere im not supposed to be
you cant steal the things that god has given me
no more pain and no more shame and misery

you cant take me down
you cant break me down
you cant take me down

you cant take me down
you cant break me down
you cant take me down

love and hate
how much more are we supposed to tolerate
cant you see theres more to me than my mistakes
sometimes i get this feeling  makes me hesitate

i believe
she wont take me somewhere im not supposed to be
you cant steal the things that god has given me
no more pain and no more shame and misery

you cant take me down
you cant break me down
you cant take me down

you cant break me down
you cant take me down
you cant break me down

i can see a place of trouble
and im on the verge
for the love of everybody
i did something wrong

now i feel some days of trouble i would stay way
in the hospital i would stay way
for the love of everybody i would stay way
but behind a wall i would stay way

standing now
