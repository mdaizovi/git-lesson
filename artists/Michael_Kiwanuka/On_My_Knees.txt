whoa on my knees
whoa i cant breathe
all that i ever prayed
that love would be where i stayed
whoa i can see
all that i believe
i know that i play the game
but ill never be ashamed

im not trying to pass the blame
im just trying to protect my name
but you know i would die for you
what you dreamin it cant be true
i can see how you tarnish me
how you gave me the third degree
i dont need to apologize
i could lie to you every night
when you stole from me everything
you just gave me a song to sing
you can leave me inside to die
what you mean is i never cry
there are things we can never see
i need god would you pray for me
weve been lost in the memory
all the darkness was meant to be

whoa on my knees
whoa i cant breathe
all that i ever prayed
love would be where i stayed
whoa i can see
all that i believe
i know that i play the game
but ill never be ashamed

whoa on my knees
oh and i cant be
i can hear angels sing
im tired of the place im in
whoa holy ground
give me the sweetest sound
i know where id rather be
the silence is heavenly

if i paint you a masterpiece
would my pain and my hurt decrease
if im able to make you cry
would you love me and want me more
i just want you to understand
that im only a broken man
and my heart it can only show
all the things we can never know
theres no need to apologize
well get back to the other side
i been walkin on solid ground
wait til you see what i have found
ive prayed for the stars above
im no longer the man you loved
ive become who i meant to be
when i needed you next to me

whoa on my knees
whoa i cant breathe
all that i ever prayed
whoa i believe i believe whoa whoa

i believe oh
i believe yeah
oh i believe
that ima walk away
oh i believe

oh oh i believe
oh now oh i can see yeah
oh i believe

whoa on my knees
whoa i cant breathe
all that i ever prayed
that love would be where i stayed
whoa i can see
all that i believe
i can hear angels sing
tired of the place im in
