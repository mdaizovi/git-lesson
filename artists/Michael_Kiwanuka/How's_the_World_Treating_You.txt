ive had nothing but sorrow
since you said we were through
theres no hope for tomorrow

hows the world treating you
every sweet thing that matters
has been broken in two
all my dreams have been shattered
hows the world treating you
got no plans for next sunday
got no plans for today
every day is blue monday
every day youre away
though our pathways have parted
to your memory im true
guess ill stay brokenhearted
hows the world treating you
do you wonder about me
like im hoping you do
are you lonesome without me
have you found someone new
are you burning and yearning
do you ever get blue
do you think of returning
hows the world treating you
