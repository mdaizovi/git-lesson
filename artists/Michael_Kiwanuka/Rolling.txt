no tears for the young
a bullet if you run away
another lost one
like father like son we pray

rolling with the times
dont be late
rolling with the times rolling
dont be late

phantom pain in your arm
tryna make a mark and change
its tearing you apart
afraid of the darker days

rolling with the times
dont be late
rolling with the times rolling
dont be late

dont be late
yeah rolling with the times
dont be late
roll on down

dont be late now
stay on down 
rolling
rolling with the times rolling with the times yeah
wont you roll wont you stay around town
oh gotta be on rolling
