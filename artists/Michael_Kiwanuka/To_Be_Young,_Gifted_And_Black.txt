to be young gifted and black
oh what a lovely precious dream
to be young gifted and black
open your heart to what i mean

in the whole world you know
there are boys and girls
who are young gifted and black
and thats a fact

you are young gifted and black
we must begin to tell our young
theres a world waiting for you
yours is the quest thats just begun

when you feel really low
theres a great truth you should know
you are young gifted and black
your souls intact

to be young gifted and black
how i long to know the truth
there are times when i look back
and i am haunted by my youth

and my joy of today
is that we can all be proud to say
to be young gifted and black
is where its at

is where its at
