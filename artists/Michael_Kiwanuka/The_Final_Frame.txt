i said i wanted you
and you from the start
i could tell you apart
but my heart fell and broke in two
you felt the pain for my foolish games
didnt know what i stood to lose
i realized that youd be my life its true
loves been a strain a strain in my heart
im numb to the feeling

its too late to run away
the final frame will never know
just float away in our parade
of love and pain away we go away we go

i said i wanted to
do all i can to be a good man
but the scene i fell in to
took me away but what can i say
its the times im living through
and we cant pretend
were reaching the end its true
loves been a strain a strain in my heart
im numb to the feeling

its too late to run away
the final frame will never know
just float away in our parade
of love and pain away we go away we go
