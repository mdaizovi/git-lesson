little butterfly without wings how do you fly
youre holdin on so tight that you dont even try
and if i had a dream if i had a dream
love would be sunshine for me
you are my air to breathe
youre just like honey to a bee

better believe ill be back
its hard to say goodbye
better believe ill be back
it hurts you every time

when you appeared to me
you let me know what love could be
you gave me confidence
you showed me light you stayed with me
its you im dreamin of you im dreamin of
night and day when i contemplate
you are my everything
im standin with you you are my heart

better believe ill be back
its hard to say goodbye
better believe ill be back
it gets you every time
better believe ill be back
its hard to say goodbye

i feel it all around theres a fire in my spirit
leadin you around cause im down tonight
feelin like a clown cause im cryin every minute
well get by tonight well get by tonight

better believe ill be back whoa whoa
its hard to say goodbye
better believe ill be back whoa whoa
