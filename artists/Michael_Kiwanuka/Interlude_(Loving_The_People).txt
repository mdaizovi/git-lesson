a moving feeling within me
that i was sitting there demanding a godgiven right
and my soul became satisfied that i was right in what i was doing
at the same time there was something deep down within me
moving me
that i could no longer be satisfied or go along with an evil system
that i had to be maladjusted to
yet in spite of all of this i had to keep loving the people
who denied me service
who stared at me
