ill never love somebody
ill never love somebody
leave me cold
trouble song in the moonlight
will be my bride

ill never need somebody
ill never need somebody
leave me alone
a worried mind in the violence
will be my guide

ill never hold somebody
ill never hold somebody
for very long
i make love but only for a night
and ill be gone

ill never love somebody
ill never love somebody
leave me cold
the trouble song in the moonlight
will be my bride
will be my bride
will be my bride
will be my bride
