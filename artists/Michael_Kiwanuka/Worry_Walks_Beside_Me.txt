worry walks beside me every day
they say i should run but its comin my way
ill be doin fine if you just leave me behind

coming all over and under my skin
say if i follow i will die like a king
ill be doin fine if you just leave me behind

what will it take to believe i can run
what will it take when will i be done
ive been trying
i find him standing here all the time

i find him trying to steal all thats mine

ill be doin fine if you just leave me behind

what will it take to believe i can run
what will it take when will i be done
ive been trying

what will it take to be free again
i wanna leave this behind
what will it take just to see again
all this is making me blind
what will it take to believe i can run
what will it take when will i be done
ive been trying
how does it feel to be flying away
how does it feel to believe today
ive been trying
worry walks beside me everyday
