tell me a tale that always was
sing me a song that ill always be in
tell me a story that i can read
tell me a story that i believe

paint me a picture that i can see
give me a touch that i can feel
turn me around so i can be
everything i was meant to be

give me a sound that i wont refuse
tell me a story that i can read
tell me a story that i can believe

tell me a tale that always was
sing me a song that ill always be in
turn me around so i can be
everything i was meant to be
