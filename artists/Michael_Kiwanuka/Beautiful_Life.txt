colors fool my brain as daylight fills my window
what a fool i was to sit and watch you go
falling through my arms like whispers through my heartstrings
on and on it goes

running oh so far from days that left me lonely
people come sometimes and then they let you go
i dont know myself but boy you really showed me
on and on it goes

you give me life
beautiful life

all my chains are go and all the guns are loaded
i need someone close to never let me go
someones calling and i hear like an echo
on and on it goes

you give me life
beautiful life

but its a beautiful good life
ive had the feeling my whole life
i was caught in a nightmare
now were breathing the same air
i live my life in a daydream
all the colors are so clean
and its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life

someone love me cause i feel like i could explode
you made peace i start a war all on my own
falling through my arms like whispers through my heartstrings
on and on it goes

you give me life
beautiful life

but its a beautiful good life
ive had the feeling my whole life
i was caught in a nightmare
now were breathing the same air
i live my life in a daydream
all the colors are so clean
and its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life
you know the world is a jungle
but you dont have to crumble
cause its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life
its a beautiful good life
