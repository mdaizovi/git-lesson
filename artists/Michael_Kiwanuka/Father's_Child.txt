feels like ive been here before
all things dont seem the same no more
although i know im my mothers child

i gotta break free into the wild

some things just seem to take so long
ive been thinking bout whats gone wrong
ive been searching for miles and miles
looking for someone to walk with me

walk with me walk walk
walk with me walk walk
walk with me walk walk
walk with me walk walk

all this doubts been troublin me
theres so much more that i can be
it feels like im on borrowed time
you got yours i gotta take whats mine

walk with me walk walk
walk with me walk walk
walk with me walk walk
walk with me walk walk

walk with me i know who i wasnt supposed to be
walk with me show me the right direction
walk with me although ive been searching all my life for where im supposed be
i am my mothers child
walk with me show me pure affection
walk with me show me the right direction
i am my fathers child even though i walk
no more no more
i am more than things you wont forgive
walk with me
i am more than things you wont forgive
