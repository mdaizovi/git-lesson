oh comfort me brother
somethings heavy on my mind
now i sit and wonder
what it is it that i cant find 
cant find peace all on my own
cant seem to get there on and on
so come hear me brother i wont lie

now i have been broken
no longer am i blind
my lesser has spoken and
most of me is left behind
wont find freedom here on my own
cant seem to get there all alone
so come hear me brother i wont lie

you never leave me
youll always be part of the person ill become
and ill never leave you
you give me memories that i know could never leave
oh yeah

you never leave me
youll always be part of the person ill become
and ill never leave you
you give me memories that i know could never leave
on my knees all on my own
cant seem to get there oll alone
so come hear me brother i wont lie
