sleep down leap down

feel the pain of each troubled history
theyll wipe his memories then tell him his past is a mystery
what is life without victory opinion on liberty enlighten me
how to stay sane in a world so mental
world sick enough a voodoo child playin purple haze
cant get no relief lonely hours never temporary
he knows at some point he will escape eventually
still goin to heights coincidentally hes a mess
but still good at puttin on a brave face for the camera
he smiles you can tell its fake you can tell its fake
the fee seldom that you be takin to heavens gates
no id no entry 27 club says
the good fly young the good are our greats
jimi basquiat amy robert janis kurt cobain

when the stars die young
took 27 years to realize
you already won
flowers all flowers all flowers all flowers all for you

shes problematic nobody cant stand it
been told shes a liability and not an asset
fck how ima write it confessions of an addict
how they let me sing to the masses
lost what i had starin in the face of tragic
like i didnt just back to black it
love was my losin game lets just call a spade a spade
paparazzi on my doorstep never leavin home
lyin on the floor minds blown tryna reach the phone
let me take one more hit fore my eyes close
let me take one more hit fore my eyes close
shit i think that was my last hit

one more hit before my eyes close
one more hit before my eyes close
one more hit before my eyes close
one more hit before my eyes close

flowers all flowers all flowers all flowers all for you
flowers all for you

can you feel this elegy all we have is memories
always heard but never seen this is more than you know
connect with my body and soul and do what my body is told
picture a beautiful sight but not all that glitters is gold
afraid of what the future may hold for me

if its too late before they dismantle my desires already won
this is a formality flowers all flowers all oh
try not to be so optimistic already won

you already you already won
you got the power you got the power
flowers all flowers all for you
whoa all for you
