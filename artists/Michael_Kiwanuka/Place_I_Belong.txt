ooh look all around
i get the feeling something is wrong
ooh im moving on
my friends are leaving my friends are gone

youre walking fast
youre losing
youre leaving your path behind
youre going home

ooh whats on your mind

ooh its so unkind

youre walking fast
youre losing
youre leaving your path behind
youre going home

im in a place i belong
im when im here on my own
im in a place i belong
