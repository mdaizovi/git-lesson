how does it feel when its quiet and calm
and will i be denied
how will it feel when its time to move on
mother says kneel and pray
when it gets hard i will roll those sleeves
life can be so unkind
i will be found on the edge of the world
where therell be no one around

oh solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
solid ground

how does it feel to be on your own
no one to understand
i know im here and i dont belong
im on my knees today
when it gets dark i will know no fear
life can be so unkind
hanging around on the edge of the world
finally no one around

oh would you help me
i dont understand
is it over
am i losing solid ground

solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
solid ground
