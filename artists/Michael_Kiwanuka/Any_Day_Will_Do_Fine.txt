my trouble upon you
there where you lay
theyve never known
for ive never shown

your time will afford you
my custom be paid
theyve never known
for ive never shown
hey listen god
after this song is through
ill be changing my ways
god knows ive seen better days

hey listen god
forgive me if i seem rude
now your dues have been paid
foolish mess that we made
my trouble upon you
there where you lay
theyve never known
for ive never shown

your time will afford you
my custom be paid
theyve never known
for ive never shown
