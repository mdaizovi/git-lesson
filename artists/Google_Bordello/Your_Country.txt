your country raised you your country fed you
and just like any other country it will break you
on front line send you tax the hell out you
and just like any other country it will lock you up you

unfortunately therell be no judgment day
it would be kind of fun to see what they would have to say
when the god they preached would actually be there
and all who didnt like the stooges would go to fucking hell

your country raised you your country fed you
and just like any other country it will break you
on front line send you tax the hell out you
and just like any other country it will fck you up you

but even all the garbage that they pour over our eyes
does not prevent us from living most magical of lifes

what are all these countries and how did they appear
and who cut up the cake and who brought up all this gear
did it have to do anything with its peoples will
i dont know i dont know i dont know my dear

its six in the morning im down in new orleans
sister paintings on your wall they will speak to me
and up later on we resume salutations
to the rest of local tribal connections

now think about that sweet baby girl

sweet baby girl sweet baby girl
sweet baby girl sweet baby girl
