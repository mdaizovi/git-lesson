rebellious love
is begging door to door
but finds the silence
like no one lives there anymore

rebellious love
this day aint got no place
and is running out of town
in shame and covering its face

love is running back to god
back to god back to god
god is running after man
after man after man

men all run to the unknown
the unknown the unknown
from unknown love comes again

capture capture
capture capture capture capture
will they ever capture
one another
will the cowards ever get to capture us

rebellious love
your destinys arranged
your days are numbered
and soon you will be caged

but rebellious love
im coming after you
cause without you
there is nothing for me here to do

love is running back to god
back to god back to god
god is running after man
after man after man

men all run to the unknown
the unknown the unknown
from unknown love comes again

capture capture
capture capture capture capture
will they ever capture
one another
will the cowards ever get to capture us

capture capture
capture capture capture capture
will they ever capture
one another
will the cowards ever get to capture us

woyoyoyoy
woyoyoyoyoyoyoy
will the cowards ever get to capture us

woyoyoyoy
woyoyoyoyoyoyoy
will the cowards ever get to capture us

aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
will the cowards ever get to capture us
aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
capture capture will they ever capture
will the cowards ever get to capture us
