ah here he comes he comes here he comes acourting

to put all the don juans to shame

therell be cadre dance for all the beautiful and homely

no one will slip away

from a spider



oh dark is his web and thousand of creatures

in it they shine just like the stars

but more more more for even thousand of creatures

one heaven of orofices for all the arms 

of a spider



lalalai la lai la la



so here he comes he comes here he comes acourting

and there they shine just like the stars

but more more more for even thousand of creatures

one heaven of orofices for all the arms 

of a spider



lalalai la lai la la
