thirtyfive years i lay awake at night
across my mind is one eternal fight
inventing new ways to think and see
but keep old friends and answers stir always

to frontiers my kind is following the spark
to build lighthouse for those who scared of dark
to frontiers where we befriend the shark
and stare at the night but do not see the dark

of sadness madness

here i crawl to rise above
to rise above
to rise above
to rise above
oh what is godless and misleading

and touch the world
touch the world
and touch the world
and touch the world
and touch the world that isnt bleeding

cause i dont know if anywhere in this universe
there is this kind of love
i dont know if anywhere in this universe
someone like you to know

i dont know if anywhere in this universe
there is this kind of love
i dont know if anywhere in this universe
someone like you to know i

and i did see most beautiful of dreams
a cosmic harp where we were the strings
so making sure that the shudder is in tune
to loneliness we were all immune

to frontiers my kind is following the spark
to build lighthouse for those who scared of dark
to frontiers where we befriend the shark
and stare at the night to erase the mark

of sadness madness

oh here i crawl to rise above
to rise above
to rise above
to rise above
oh what is godless and misleading

and touch the world
touch the world
and touch the world
and touch the world
and touch the world that isnt bleeding

cause i dont know if anywhere in this universe
there is this kind of love
i dont know if anywhere in this universe
someone like you to know

i dont know if anywhere in this universe
there is this kind of love
i dont know if anywhere in this universe
someone like you to know i
