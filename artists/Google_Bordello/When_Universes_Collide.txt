why didnt you come when i beat my drum
and screamed off my head out into the night
scared of the slums afraid of the guns
dont wanna see the hoodlums fight

hey hey hey na na na na
dont wanna see the hoodlums fight
hey hey hey na na na na
dont wanna see the hoodlums fight

i was gonna come when i heard your drum
and you screamed your head off into the night
i grew up around different part of town
but even the universes collide

hey hey hey na na na na
even the universes collide
hey hey hey na na na na
even the universes collide

there was no letter no family matter
and by the castes we dont divide
it just father told me tonight authorities
preparing ethnocleansing rite

hey hey hey na na na na
preparing ethnocleansing rite
hey hey hey na na na na
preparing ethnocleansing rite

two helicopters with machine guns
over the slums proudly will glide
so when the universes collide
son dont get caught on the wrong side

hey hey hey na na na na
when the universes collide
hey hey hey na na na na
son dont get caught on the wrong side

hey hey hey na na na na
when the universes collide
hey hey hey na na na na
son dont get caught on the wrong side

hey hey hey na na na na
when the universes collide
hey hey hey na na na na
son dont get caught on the wrong side

why didnt you come when i beat my drum
and screamed off my head out into the rain
your mother told you our father stopped you
out of the hospitals you are afraid

hey hey hey na na na na
when the universe will collide
hey hey hey hey na na na na
dont get caught up on the wrong side

oh oh hey na na na na
oh when the universe will collide
oh oh hey na na na na
son dont get caught up on the wrong side
