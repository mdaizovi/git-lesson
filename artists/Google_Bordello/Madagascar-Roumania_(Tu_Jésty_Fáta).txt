so now you tell me you are living in a country
where joys and freedom they can not be tried
but alone in your mind there are so many rooms
that you never seem to find
there is a room where your toolbox is waiting
but you just never go there when you are awake
when most of the time whatever that you look for
you could of just sit down and make
so do the right thing just do the right thing
how can you do it if you are awake
instead i scratch my forehead like aladdin his lamp

cus even in madagascar
well find some shack below radar
put two turntables and a film projector in that room
and punk rock n roll most faithfully
it will occurecurecure  cure cure cure

instead you run to your llittle birdfeeder
and stick your beak in the seeds your master laid
where did they came from who put them in there
oh you will never know their name
but there is a room where bustle and merry
and big ceremony could be going on
where your true talents along with birthrights
could be dancing cancan
cus even in madagascar and even in antarctica
even in azerbaijan
put two turntables and a film projector in that room
and punk rock n roll most faithfully
it will occurecurecure cure cure cure
and sewing machine too
