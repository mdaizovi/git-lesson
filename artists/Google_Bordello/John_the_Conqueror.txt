hey john the conqueror
growing on the sunny side
ive heard about you
from people of a healing kind

people of a healing kind
they said your name i need to call
if im sick or down in trouble
or need anything at all

so i went on a mighty
highway byway ride
and dancing on the roadside
guess who did i find

i said hey man whats you name
and he said think about
think about it
cause truth is always the same

living and loving
truth is always the same
living and loving
the rest is insane

john the conqueror
was nowhere to be found
so i asked about him
people of the mystic kind

people of the mystic kind
said hes no secret at all
if you broke or down and out
or need anything at all

so i traveled world around me
and i went back inside
and dancing on my ribs
guess who did i find

i said hey man whats your name
and he said think about it
think about it
cause truth is always the same

living and loving
truth is always the same
living and loving
the rest is insane

gather round people
gather round here

living and loving
truth is always the same
living and loving
the rest is insane

americas people
truth is always the same
russian people

asian people
truth is always the same
african people
the rest is insane
