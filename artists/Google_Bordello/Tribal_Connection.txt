where theres a music should be comin out of every car
there is a silence all over downtown
where community celebrations shall be aroused
i walk the sterile gardens life is on pause here it is

no can do this no can do that
what the hell can you do my friend
in this place that you call your town

no can do this no can do that
what the hell can you do my friend
in this place that you call your town

i guess you cant expect much from the hometown
well i dont know if you can even call it your own
when they dont want you to get near excitement
and in protest of that you just stay home here it is now

no can do this no can do that
what the hell can you do my friend
in this place that you call your town

no can do this no can do that
what the hell can you do my friend
in this place that you call your town

party party party party party party
party party party party party party
party party party party party party
party party party party party party
party party party party after party

on intersection of all dimensions
where i was stoppin by just for a drink
i meet a brother from tribal connection
and together we began to sing

we gonna turn frustration into inspiration
whatever demons are there we gonna set them free
such is the method of tribal connection
of our fun loving restless breed

i wanna walk this earth like it is mine
and so is everyone in our fun lovin tribe
cmon man is that real so much to ask
from all these goddamn nazifuedals

but im gonna take it to community
cause i want everyone to see
there never was any conspiracy
and we are all here simply to sing

no can do this no can do that
what the hell can you do my friend
in this place that you call your town

no can do this no can do that
what the hell can you do my friend
in this place that you call your town

where theres a music should be comin out of every car
there is a silence all over downtown
only the intersection semialive
outskirts are sedated me gone
