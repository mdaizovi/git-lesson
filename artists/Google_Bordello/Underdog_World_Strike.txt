i am a foreigner 
and im walking through new streets
but before i want to i see the same deeds
inherited by few a power machine
that crushed and strangles you right in your sleep

but be it me or its you 
the leisure class i think we all know
that be it punk hiphop be it a reggae sound
it is all connected through
the gypsy part of town
lets go

its the underdog world strike
its the underdog world strike

and let your girl scouts 
lipsynch about the freedom
just the way you want them but soon enough youll see them
soon enough they all turn around
and soon enough youll see them in a different part of town

cause be it me or its you
the leisure class i think we all know
that be it punk hiphop or be it a reggae sound
it is all connected through 
the gypsy part of town
lets go

its the underdog world strike
its the underdog world strike
its the underdog world strike
