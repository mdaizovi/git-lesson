welcome to the hutzovina border
come see what we got
kontrabanda pranadonors ai
never mind now securitate its a tihiy chase
latche romenitza bravinta pjas

now over the bridges and over the fence
over the skyline and over power plants
hopping like a monkey on a holy toothpick
is a rabbit on a pogogypsy stick

give me no pain no great suffer
no bored striptease with dead snake
give me skin that is dressed lively
give it to me for kurav sake

hey chavorale da gren ame tradasa
ame pro targo viparuvasa
ai da na targostir or love las
lache romenitza bravinta pjas
