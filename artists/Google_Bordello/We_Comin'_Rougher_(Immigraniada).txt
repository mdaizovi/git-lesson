were coming rougher every time

were coming rougher
were coming rougher
were coming rougher every time

immigrada immigraniada
immigrada immigraniadada
immigrada immigraniada
were coming rougher every time

in corridors full of tear gas
our destinies jammed every day
like deleted scenes from kafka
flushed down the bureaucratic drain

but if you give me the invitation
to hear the bells of freedom chime
to hell with your double standards
were coming rougher every time

were coming rougher
were coming rougher
were coming rougher every time

immigrada immigraniada
immigrada immigraniadada
immigrada immigraniada
were coming rougher every time

all those who made it and quickly jaded
to them we got nothing to say
our immigrada immigraniada
for them its don quixotes kind of way
but if you give me the invitation
to hear the bells of freedom chime
to hell with your double standards
were coming rougher every time
were coming rougher
were coming rougher
were coming rougher every time
were coming rougher every time

were coming rougher every time

frozen eyes sweaty back
my familys sleeping on a railroad track
all my life i packunpack
but man i got to earn this buck
i gotta pay representation
to be accepted in a nation
where after efforts of a hero
welcome start again from zero

its a book of our true stories
true stories that cant be denied
its more than true it actually happened
its more than true it actually happened
its more than true it actually happened
were coming rougher every time
rougher every time
were coming rougher every time
