hey rejuvenation the second wind
when when when when will it begin
repatriation what is my sin
when when when when will my ship come in

first i asked the sailor to sneak me aboard
bring me place my father showed me my first guitar chord
place where lie of second thought cannot survive
place where all my friends are still alive

lost innocent world
lost innocent paradise
where did you go
i payed too high a price
lost innocent world
lost innocent paradise
once i get you back
ill never sacrifice

da da da

then i asked every geisha from the willow town
but nobody wanted to see death of a clown
we danced shanghai tango like no tomorrow jive
when kung fu master found me he asked me are you still alive

lost innocent world
lost innocent paradise
where did you go
i payed too high a price
lost innocent world
lost innocent paradise
once i get you back
ill never sacrifice

da da da

lost innocent world
my lost innocent paradise
where did you go
i payed too high a price

lost innocent world
lost innocent paradise
where did you go
i payed too high a price
lost innocent world
lost innocent paradise
once i get you back
ill never sacrifice
