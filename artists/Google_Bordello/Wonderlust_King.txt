back in the day yo as we learned

simple because im not a total gadjo
da ja shut ja tziratch nu tak stozge

i traveled the world looking for understanding
of the times that we live in
hunting and gathering first hand information
challenging definitions of sin

i traveled the world looking for lovers
of the ultimate beauty but never settled in

im a wonderlust king
i stay on the run let me out let me be gone
in the world beat up road sign
i saw new history of a time new history of time

and presidents and billionaires and generals
theyll never know theyll never know
what i have owned what i have owned

im a wonderlust king
