yeah oh yeah you seen me walk on burning bridges
yeah oh yeah you seen me fall in love with witches
and you know my head is held inside by stitches
yet you know i did survive all of your lonely sieges

and you know that ill pick up every time you call
just to thank you one more time
alcohol oh alcohol alcohol

and you know that ill survive very time you call
just to thank you one more time for everything youve done
alcohol alcohol

i am sorry some of us given you bad name
yeah oh yeah cause we love you nothing is the same
yeah oh yeah i miss you so every time we breakup
just to hit a higher note every time we makeup

and you know that ill pick up every time you call
just to thank you one more time
alcohol alcohol alcohol

so now you know i will survive every time you call
just to thank you one more time for everything youve done
foreign content

now you know that ill pick up every time you call
incomprehensible
alcohol alcohol alcohol alcohol

who is crawling up my spine
alcohol
i was waiting long long time
alcohol

now you teach me how to rhyme
alcohol
just dont stab in the back with a cortisol
alcohol

now forever reunite
alcohol
now you teach me how to rhyme
alcohol

screw a light bulb in my head
alcohol
may the ceremony be happy or sad

and you know that ill pick up every time you call
just to thank you one more time for everything youve done
and you know that ill pick up every time you call
just to thank you one more time alcohol
