if you dont see no punks in downtown
do you know this town is dying quick
its just no good
ill get it to you in this now
youll have a trouble finding goddamn prostitutes

in this gutter town
the girls are stingy and guys are broke
in this gutter town
you will be always dying for a poke

in this gutter town
the logical balance is absurd
and in this gutter town
the women they never get wet

and in this gutter town
music is only unverified
and in this gutter town
oh

so thats when i pull over a taxico
with my new friends from mexico
and with limited unverified
we started new punk rock parranda
ohh punk punk

if music doesnt come from windows
you know that somethings definitely wrong
its fucking wrong
and all the cars they pass in silence

and if there is no guitar in a house
you know its owner he cannot be trusted
and if there is no drum set in the office
dont be surprised when the business get busted

and if your spouse doesnt play a sitar
dont expect a whole lot of commitment
and if president doesnt play the sax
he will not get an undertable treatment

and in this gutter town
say you kick somebody in the head
they just they likely sue you
but man they dont get mad

so thats when i pull over a taxico
with my new friends from mexico
and with limited unverified
we started new samba

and in this gutter town
the logical balance is absurd
and in this gutter town
the women they never get wet
