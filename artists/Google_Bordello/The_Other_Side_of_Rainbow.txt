when the snow is getting heavy
trees just bend and let it go
so how many so how many
broken bones it takes to know

so wake up my principessa
and dont let me out of your sight
ive seen the other side of rainbow
and it was black and white 
it was black and white

ive seen the other side of rainbow
it was black and white
it was black and white

the way to freedom the way to freedom
that i used to know
is in the deeper is in the deeper knowing of my soul
the way to freedom the way to freedom that i used to know
ritmo lay ritmo lay
ritmo lay the flow
ritmo lay ritmo lay
ritmo lay the flow

when your enemy gets cruel
let em down dont break him down
and if you hear of something good
dont hold it back pass it around

so wake up my mamasutra
and dont let me out of your sight
ive seen the other side of rainbow
and it was black and white
it was black and white

ive seen the other side of rainbow
it was black and white
it was black and white

the way to freedom the way to freedom
that i used to know
is in the deeper is in the deeper knowing of my soul
the way to freedom the way to freedom that i used to know
ritmo lay ritmo lay
ritmo lay the flow
ritmo lay ritmo lay
ritmo lay the flow

the way to freedom the way to freedom
that i used to know
ritmo lay ritmo lay
ritmo lay the flow
ritmo lay ritmo lay
ritmo lay the flow

the way to freedom the way to freedom
that i used to know
is in the deeper is in the deeper knowing of my soul
