when i was younger i lived in fear
that incarceration of some kind is near
i checked my head in tact with rules
i nearly became a goddamn fool

but ive heard voices not in the head
out in the air they called ahead
through ripped out speakers
through thick and thin
they found a shelter
under my skin

how many darkest moments and traps
still lay ahead of us
how many final frontiers
we gonna mount
and maybe no victory laps
but if you stepped on path of sacred art
and stuck it out through thick and thin
god knows you become one
with undestructable

and so no longer live i in fear
them are too greedy to pay my asylum bills
this is my life and freedom is my profession
this is my mission throughout all flight duration

there is a core and its hardcore
all is hardcore when made with love
love is a voice of a savage soul
this savage love is undestructable

how many darkest moments and traps
still lay ahead of us
undestructable
how many final frontiers we gonna mount
with maybe no victory laps
undestructable
but if you stepped on path of sacred art
and stuck it out through thick and thin
god knows you become one
with undestructable

undestructable

how many
undestructable
how many final frontiers
with maybe no victory laps
undestructable
but if you stand on path of sacred art
and stuck it out through thick and thin
god knows you become one
with undestructable

ох сколько мгновений чёрных
невозможных
нам всем предстоит преодолеть
ох сколько пиров победных впереди
но всё равно нам не успеть
но если если сокровенный путь один 
ты будешь несокрушим
несокрушим

undestructable
