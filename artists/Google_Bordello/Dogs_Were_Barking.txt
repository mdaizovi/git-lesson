dogs were barking guests were parking
and my wedding was about to start
dogs were barking monkeys clapping
then i got up on table and i said
ill meet you 1045 on the broadway canal
in a discoradicaltransglobal
comanja cooking up the original mixtura
s ulitzy do ulitzy the brilliant bassura

papa v gogol bordello
energija probuzdenija i ja
dogs were barking monkeys clapping
bears were dancing and girls were cutting loose
cops were lurking kids were snarkling
then her father came up to me and said
vi bivali kogda nibud na vistavke sobak
she was a 545 nashe delo tabak
da ja zge starij dobrij optahotzahtzulodzigit
govorjat prosto blolnoi tak nichego zge ne bilit

remember things that are eternal
eternal thingsyou forgot those things
nelzja ponjat nelzja izmerit
tolko prostzat i tolko vvis
to make it all even more crooked
is impossibility of a suicide
you pull the trigger yet you are still standing
just somewhere else but with same dick in your hand

now dub it tovarisch like tovarisch would
