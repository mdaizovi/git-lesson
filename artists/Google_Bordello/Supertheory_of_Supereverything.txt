first time i had read the bible
it had stroke me as unwitty
i think it may started rumor
that the lord aint got no humor

put me inside ssc
lets test superstring theory
oh yoi yoi accelerate the protons
stir it twice and then just add me cause

i dont read the bible
i dont trust disciple
even if theyre made of marble
or canal street bling

from the maelstrom of the knowledge
into the labyrinth of doubt
frozed underground ocean
melting nuking on my mind

yes give me everything theory
without nazi uniformity
my brothers are protons
my sisters are neurons
stir it twice its instant family

i dont read the bible
i dont trust disciple
even if theyre made of marble
or canal street bling

my brothers are protons
my sisters are neurons
stir it twice dlja prekrastnih dam

do you have sex maniacs
or schizophrenics
or astrophysicists in your family
was my grandma anti anti
was my grandpa bounty bounty
hekohekohejo
they ask me in embassy

cause i dont read the bible
i dont trust disciple
even if theyre made of marble
or canal street bling

and my grandma she was anti
and my grandpa he was bounty
and stir it twice
and then just add me
party party party party party party
