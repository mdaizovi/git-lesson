i never was unruled poseidon
my name it was so often forgotten
but i’m inside of every tree
i’m inside of every atom
sky and earth united by me
i’m unity i’m gravity
i’m a warrior turned dove
i’m hieroglyph of love love
hieroglyph of love love

if i’m gone before you cry
it’s illusion all illusions must die
i simply am and will always be
waiting for you to discover me
i’m unity i’m gravity
i’m wind of eternity
i’m a warrior turned dove
i’m hieroglyph of love love
hieroglyph of love love

passion can be quiet it can be still
waiting to confront of something real
against the lows i’m still here
i’m always with you i’m always near
sky and earth united by me
i’m unity i’m gravity
i’m a warrior turned dove
i’m hieroglyph of love love
hieroglyph of love love
