sometimes when facing common trouble
when whole town is screwed
we become actually human
act like prometheus would
suddenly there is more humor
and a party tabor style
people ringing one another
yo man how was your blackout
suddenly there is more music
made with the buckets in the park
girls are dancing with the flashlights
i got only one guitar
and you see brothers and sisters
all engaged in sport of help
making merry out of nothing
like in refugee camp

oh yeah oh no it doesnt have to be so
it is possible any time anywhere
even without any dough
oh yeah oh no it doesnt have to be so
the forces of the creative mind are unstoppable

and you think all right now people
they have finally woked up
but as soon as the trouble over
watch them take another nap
nobody is making merry
only trotting scared of boss
everybodys making hurry
for some old forgotten cause
but one thing is surely eternal
its condition of a man
who dont know where he is going
who dont know where does he stand
whos dream power is a bottle
put away in dry dark place
whos youth power is well buried
under propaganda waves
whos dream life is in opposition
to the life he leads today
whos beaten down in believing
it just kinda goes this way

oh yeah oh no it doesnt have to be so
it is possible any time anywhere
even without any dough
oh yeah oh no it doesnt have to be so
the forces of the creative mind are unstoppable
