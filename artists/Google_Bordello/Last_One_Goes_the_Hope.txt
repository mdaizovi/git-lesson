unvisible barbed wire all along
around the neck of my song
he romale im beat up but going strong

unstoppable fire of my tongue
and the path ahead thats long
will get me at the end where i belong

cause ive seen ship of fools
sinking in the dunes
as i dragged my coffin on the rope

them all look down at me
but i got all the help i need
cause the last one last one goes the hope
last one last one goes the hope

unseizable diamond from my sling
still is searching for its ring
in a city of ruins where no one sings

but zombies and willful slaves
living in their tiny private caves
crooked hands digging up the graves

yeah ive seen ship of fools
sinking in the dunes
as i dragged my coffin on the rope

them all look down at me
but i got all the help i need
cause the last one last one goes the hope
last one last one goes the hope

last one last one goes the hope
last one last one goes the hope

he romale no passarán
hey chavale non rien de rien
you see the thunderbird already starts to spin

he romale no passarán
he chavale non rien de rien
hey venceremos vse ravno my pobedim

cause ive seen ship of fools
sinking in the dunes
as i dragged my coffin on the rope

them all look down at me
but i got all the help i need
cause the last one last one goes the hope

oh ho last one last one goes the hope
oh ho last one last one goes the hope
oh ho last one last one goes the hope
