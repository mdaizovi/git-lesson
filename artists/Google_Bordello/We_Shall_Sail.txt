hey brother stranger you know we shall sail
even if even if only to fail
cause winning and losing keep journey amusing
down down down
your destiny trail

hey brother stranger you know we shall sail
so living and loving may never go stale
cause hustle and bustle shall get you to the muscle
and for you coffin a nail

but nothing in this life is good or bad
its we who dress it up as happy or sad
and nothing in this life is a sheer must
yet in living and loving indeed we trust

if you got no place where you belong
shoulder of stranger just as good and strong
come in to my house in middle of the night
and dont dont hesitate
kick that door out
hey kick it out

cause nothing in this life is good or bad
its we who dress it up as happy or sad
and no one in this life is sinner or saint
its just energy running up the stream
or down the drain
and nothing in this life is a sheer must
yet in living and loving indeed we trust
indeed we trust

hey brother stranger you know we shall sail
even if even if only to fail
cause winning and losing keep journey amusing
down down down
your destiny trail

once i met an argentinian girl
she had a sister
and no matter what i did
there aint no way on jealous sister
there aint no way on jealous sister
there aint no way on jealous sister
